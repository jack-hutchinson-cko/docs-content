Authorization
-------------

The cardholder's issuing bank approved a payment and the payment amount is held on the customer’s card, but not yet transferred to your account. Authorized payments must be captured within 7 days. Otherwise, the payment will be voided automatically and the payment amount will be released back to the cardholder. 

| Action | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `AUTH` | The payment has been approved by the issuer and the amount is held on the customer’s card. |
| `AUTH PENDING` | For 3DS payments, is displayed while the system waits for the customer to pass the required checks. |
| `AUTH FLAG` | The payment triggered a risk scenario and needs to be reviewed manually at your level before capturing or voiding the payment. |
| `AUTH FAILED` | The cardholder’s issuing bank did not approve the payment. |
| `CARD V.`| The card verification request has been approved and the cardholder’s details have been saved to their account. <br> This action is applicable when performing a [card verification](/display/DOCS/Card+verification). |
| `CARD V. FLAG`| The card verification request has been approved, but the charge is set to be flagged. <br> This action is applicable when performing a [card verification](/display/DOCS/Card+verification). |
| `CARD V. FAILED`| The card verification request could not be processed. <br> This action is applicable when performing a [card verification](/display/DOCS/Card+verification). |

If the original payment was processed under a 3D Secure environment, the action will include `3D` at the end.

Void

This action is rare and will usually be related to the issuing bank having a technical issue at their end. We encourage you to re-attempt payments with this action after a few hours.
