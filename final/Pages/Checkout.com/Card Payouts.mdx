title: Card Payouts
account: ABC
---


Send money to a card in minutes. Using Visa Direct and Mastercard Moneysend, you can transfer funds directly to cards across over 180 countries.

This feature is available for merchants incorporated in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, the European Economic Area (EEA), and Singapore.

Before you start
----------------

*   [Verify the recipient's card](/display/DOCS/Card+verification) to make sure it is eligible to accept payouts and check whether it is enabled for Fast Funds.
*   [Get a foreign exchange rate quote](/display/DOCS/FX+rates+endpoint) if you're paying out in a currency that's different from the currency of your account.

Step 1: Make a payout request
-----------------------------

You can send a payout using either:

*   a [token](#CardPayouts-token), 
*   a [payment instrument](#CardPayouts-paymentinstrument), or 
*   the [full card details](#CardPayouts-carddetails).

### Transaction types

There are three main types of Card Payout transaction:

| Transaction type | Description | Sender data required? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Direct funds disbursement | You send money directly to a cardholder. | No |
| Third-party funds disbursement | You send money to a cardholder on behalf of a business or other entity. | Yes |
| Money transfer | You send money to a cardholder on behalf of an individual. | Yes |

Sender data

You must include the details of the sender in your payout request when you're sending money on behalf of someone else (third-party funds disbursements and money transfers). For details of the sender data required, see our [sender data guide](/display/DOCS/Sender+data+for+Card+Payouts).

### Payout request using a token 

Create a payout request with a token (the tokenized details of a payment card) as the destination.

Tokens are single use and only have a 15-minute lifespan.

### Payout request using a payment instrument 

Create a payout request with a payment instrument as the destination.

A payment instrument is a stored payment card, kept securely in our Vault. Each payment instrument has a unique ID (for example, `src_nwd3m4in3hkuddfpjsaevunhdy`), which you can use as the destination for a card payout. Learn more about [stored payment details](/display/DOCS/Store+payment+details).

Step 2: Handle the response
---------------------------

If your payout request was successful, you'll receive a `202 Payment asynchronous or further action required` response, and the status will be `Pending` while the transaction goes through compliance checks. A [webhook and response code](#CardPayouts-outcome) will tell you the final outcome of the payout.

If there was a problem with your request, you'll receive a `422 Invalid data sent` response. You can receive this error for several reasons; the data you provided may be invalid, or your request might not comply with the specific configuration of your account. To discuss the configuration of your account, contact your Customer Success Manager.

Card payouts cannot be canceled.

        "processing_error"
      ]
    }

Step 3: Check the outcome 
--------------------------

If the payout was successful, you'll receive a `payment_paid` webhook. If it's unsuccessful, you'll get a `payment_declined` webhook. The included response code will provide more details.

You can see a record of all your payouts in your statements and in the payouts report in the Hub.

The issuing bank has full discretion over how they respond to a card payout request. If you have a question about the response code you've received, please contact the issuing bank or your Customer Success Manager.
