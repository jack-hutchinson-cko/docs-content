Risk rules
----------

| Rule | Summary |
| ---- | ---- |
| Address verification service (AVS)| AVS is widely used in the US, Canada, and UK to verify the billing address provided by the cardholder with the address on file at the issuing bank.

Only applicable to US and EU credit cards. AVS rules are only applied to charges that include the cardholder's billing address.

 |
| Velocity| Velocity rules allow you to automatically trigger actions based on the frequency of transactions with matching attributes over a specific period. These can be set up for a range of frequencies, including daily, weekly and monthly.

 |
| Mismatch| Mismatch rules can be configured to trigger when the details of a transaction do not correspond with one another (e.g., the difference in geo-location between the BIN country and the IP address of the cardholder).

 |
| Threshold| Threshold amounts can be set to trigger a defined action based on the value and currency of a transaction, typically to manage exposure to fraudulent high-value orders.

 |
| 

Verified information

| Information such as email, billing address, shipping address, etc. can be checked against the Hub’s built-in tools to verify whether the information provided is valid or is potentially fraudulent, depending on the rules and actions set.

 |
| 

High-risk countries

| A custom list of high-risk countries that helps to prevent transactions to and from more fraud-prone locations.

If you have several businesses associated with your account, you can have a different set of high-risk countries for each of them.

 |
| Blacklist management| A blacklist that rejects transactions based on four attributes: card, IP address, email, and phone number. We manage a global blacklist of cards that have been blacklisted by other Checkout.com merchants, and we block any card that has been blacklisted by at least three other merchants.
