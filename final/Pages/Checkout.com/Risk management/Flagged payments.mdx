title: Flagged payments
account: ABC
---


The flag status is used to alert you to any suspicious transactions on your account. Not every flagged payment is fraudulent, but flags indicate that a payment is worth investigating.

The risk settings configured for your business control when a flagged payment is triggered. When a payment is flagged, you must either [capture](/display/DOCS/Capture+a+payment) or [void](/display/DOCS/Void+a+payment) it manually. If you take no action, the payment expires automatically after seven days, and the funds return to the customer.

Flagged payments in the API
---------------------------

When using our API, a flagged payment is indicated in the response with `"flagged": true`. The field looks like this:

    "risk": {
      "flagged": true
    }

Flagged payments in the Hub
---------------------------

In the Hub's Payments screen, flagged payments are identified by an orange status message. Flagged payments will not be captured automatically — even with auto-capture enabled.
