When simulating a 3D Secure (3DS) payment, you will receive a redirect URL to a 3DS Authentication simulator page. The password for the 3DS simulator is `Checkout1!`.

3DS test cards
--------------

By default, the simulator will return a successful authentication response. If you want to test a different flow or transaction status, use one of the card numbers below in your authentication request. You can use any valid CVV and any future expiry date (mm/yy), unless otherwise stated.

Test cards default to 3DS2 in the sandbox environment.

### 3DS2 frictionless flow

|

### 3DS2 challenge flow

|

### 3DS1 fallback flow
