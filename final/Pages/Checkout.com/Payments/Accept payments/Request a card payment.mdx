title: Request a card payment
account: ABC
---


Once you've successfully set up your integration, you're able to start receiving and tokenizing your customers' card details. After this tokenization process, you're ready to create a payment. To do this, you can use our API and your server-side code.

How it works
------------

![](/download/attachments/5931075/Card%20token.png?version=1&modificationDate=1619631646512&api=v2)

Card tokens (`tok_`) are single use and only have a 15-minute lifespan. Once you've successfully sent your request, you'll receive a response containing a permanent card source ID (`src_`) which can be used in subsequent payment requests.

### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "token",
        "token": "tok_4gzeau5o2uqubbk6fufs3m7p54"
      },
      "amount": 6500,
      "currency": "USD",
      "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89",
      "metadata": {
        "udf1": "TEST123",
        "coupon_code": "NY2018",
        "partner_id": 123989
      }
    }

### Response example

Use the `approved` field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect. For example, if the payment is 3D Secure.

The following pages can help you understand the response message:

*   [CVV codes and descriptions](/display/DOCS/CVV+response+codes)
*   [AVS codes](/display/DOCS/AVS+codes)
*   [Response codes](/display/DOCS/Response+codes) (if the authorization was unsuccessful)

#### The possible values for the `status` field include `Authorized`, `Captured`, `Card Verified`, `Declined`, and `Pending`. Note that `Pending` only applies to 3D Secure payments and alternative payments.

Possibly fraudulent authorization requests return the message `risk.flagged: true` to show that the payment has been [flagged](/display/DOCS/Flagged+payments).

Next step
---------

Once you've successfully processed a card payment request, you're able to easily [reuse those card details](/display/DOCS/Pay+with+stored+details) for subsequent payments.
