title: Capture a payment

Our two-step authorization and capture process enables you to capture payments either automatically or manually.

When a payment is authorized, the funds are held for seven days. By default, payments are automatically captured. If you wish to manually capture, set the capture field to `false` when [requesting a payment](/display/DOCS/Request+a+card+payment). You can capture an authorized payment either in full or partially. If you don't capture it within seven days, the payment is voided.

You can [void](/display/DOCS/Void+a+payment) an authorized payment at any time. However, captured payments can only be [refunded](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Overview
--------

If a payment is created with `"capture": "false"`, you can either use this endpoint to capture the payment or capture it from the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2). Manual capture is not allowed if `capture` is set to `true`.

Partial captures

Any capture amount less than the original payment will be treated as a partial capture. You can only make one partial capture per payment.
