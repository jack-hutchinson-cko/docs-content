We also support the ability to make payments using Google Pay tokens that you have decrypted. To make use of this feature, use the `network_token` source type and specify the `token_type` as `googlepay`. This source type allows you to provide the details about the token, as well as the cryptogram and ECI value obtained from the Google Pay token.

### The POST response

If the `approved` field is `true`, your authorization was successful. If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

A successful response will include a `payment_account_reference` value, which is a unique reference to the underlying card for network tokens. If the card scheme provided us with an `eci` value, it will be included in the response. The value indicates the security level that the card scheme decided to request the payment with.
