Overview
--------

KNET payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request a KNET payment](#KNET-requestapayment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](#KNET-redirectthecustomer)

Request a payment
-----------------

### Endpoints

For the full API specification, see the [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post).

*   [**Live**](#tabs-3fed4467-51e6-4adc-89f5-29f2f37c1cb9-1)
*   [**Sandbox**](#tabs-3fed4467-51e6-4adc-89f5-29f2f37c1cb9-2)

POST`https://api.checkout.com/payments`

POST`https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments`

When sending a payment request that includes `source.card_token`, the option to pay via KFast is offered. If the token is new, the first payment will happen via the usual flow, but with the option to "register for KFast" before submitting. This flow is **not testable in the sandbox environment** because the registration for KFast requires the customer to enter a one-time password sent to the mobile phone number registered with the bank, which is not present in sandbox.

### Request example

    {
      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "KWD",
      "source": {
        "type": "knet",
        "language": "en",
        "user_defined_field1": "first user defined field",
        "user_defined_field2": "second user defined field",
        "card_token": "01234567",
        "user_defined_field4": "fourth user defined field",
        "ptlf": "96033587c7b5"
      }
    }
    

### Response example

### If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

    {
      "id": "pay_4gubyq2w335upc54dx7a4257lq",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_r3cajfpbj3ju7jyq7afcg3qc4a"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_4gubyq2w335upc54dx7a4257lq"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sbapi.ckotech.co/knet-external/redirect/tok_tl6kftlhdpzephqelsbpyovl4i/pay"
        }
      }
    }
    

Redirect the customer
---------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will allow the customer to authorize the payment, before they are transferred to your predefined success or failure URL.

Refund a payment
----------------

KNET supports full, partial and multiple partial refunds. Refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using our [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Before you can refund KNET payments, you need to contact your bank and ask them to enable refunds. Your bank will then send a request to KNET to activate the refund API.

Cancel a payment
----------------

If, after landing on the KNET payment page, the customer attempts to complete the payment after seven minutes, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired` webhook.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.

Testing KNET
------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate KNET payments in the sandbox environment.

1.  Create a KNET transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to KNET's website.
2.  Enter the following details:
    1.  **Select your bank**: Knet Test Card \[KNET1\]
    2.  **Card number**:  `888888 000 000 000 1`
    3.  **Expiration date**: `09 | 2021`
    4.  **PIN**: `1234`
3.  Click **Submit** and then click **Confirm**. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
