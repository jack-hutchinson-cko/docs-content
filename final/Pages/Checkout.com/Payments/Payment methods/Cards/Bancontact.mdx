### Response example

If you receive a `202 Success` response, with a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful. You now need to redirect your customer as described below.

    {
      "id": "pay_scoqartlkpzerp45c5ujmj6uue",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_wqzgcjuiwucudpmfu7kn5mukh4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_scoqartlkpzerp45c5ujmj6uue"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://trusted.girogate.de/ti/dumbdummy?tx=455332564&rs=O34Tn460YM76zZzI7yfXXPIsVnnWAhaV&cs=bb716499d072a5adfb314437c5965e1150b15550aac7a298b5d9d317653427a1"
        },
        "bancontact:mobile": {
          "href": "BEPGenApp://DoTx?TransId=1BC.GIROGATE.DE/BCMC/123456789$ICAE3BUIH5P9U53Y5HKA9CRT"
        }
      }
    }
    

Redirect the customer
---------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will allow the customer to authorize the payment, before they are transferred to your predefined success or failure URL.

Alternatively, use the bancontact:mobile redirection link in the response to take them to the Bancontact mobile app. This mobile redirection link, however, is only provided in the live environment and only when the `amount` is less than or equal to `50000` (500 EUR).

Refund a payment
----------------

Bancontact supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using the [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Cancel a payment
----------------

If the customer fails to complete their payment, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired` webhook.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.

Testing Bancontact
------------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Bancontact payments in the sandbox environment.

1.  Create a Bancontact transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to Bancontact's website.
2.  Set the payment response and payment delay as necessary.
3.  Click **Submit**. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
