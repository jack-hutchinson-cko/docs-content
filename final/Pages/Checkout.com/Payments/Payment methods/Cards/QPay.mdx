      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_mydbq4wrfp3excwlexeefsv3be"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_7eil5osdlcdehe62et5aihec4q"

      }

Redirect the customer
---------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will allow the customer to authorize the payment, before they are transferred to your predefined success or failure URL.

Get details about a payment
---------------------------

You can use the `payment_id` found in the payment response, or the `cko-session-id` from the success/failure URL (e.g., `https://www.checkout.com/order/succeeded?cko-session-id=**sid_vii64oquze5u3h2x6hh4rurc4y**`) to retrieve details about the payment.

The `cko-session-id` expires 15 minutes after being created.

Use the details below to set up your request.

Refund a payment
----------------

QPay supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using the [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Cancel a payment
----------------

If the customer fails to complete their payment, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired` webhook.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.
