#### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "giropay",
        "purpose":"Mens black t-shirt L"
      },  
     "amount": 1914,
     "currency": "EUR",

     "failure_url": "http://example.com/payments/fail"
    }

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

### The POST response

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, then your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_d3ohhwwu3qderfjlzitknc26sq",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_hfgq4ctsnr6e3cfhq5ctwb5gtu"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_d3ohhwwu3qderfjlzitknc26sq"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://ftg-customer-integration.giropay.de/ftgbank/b/bankselection/219499703994809788;jsessionid=8ECFE1809F9BAB6635EC9D37D98A1CAE.sf-testapp01tom21?op=001"
        }
      }
    }

Redirect the customer 
----------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will send them to a Giropay bank selection page where they will select their bank before being transferred to that bank's page to enter their authorization details. If successful, the payment can be approved.

Once they've completed this step, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of a Giropay payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.
