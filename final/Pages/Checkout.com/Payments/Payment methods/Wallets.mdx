Digital wallets allow your customers to securely make payments using any card they have saved in their wallet, or the stored funds in their wallet account.

There are two types:

*   Stored-value wallets. The customer must top up their wallet with funds before they make a transaction (e.g., Alipay).
*   Pass-through or proxy wallets. Here, the wallet simply acts as a proxy for the customer’s debit or credit card(s) – no topping up required (e.g., Apple Pay, Google Pay).
