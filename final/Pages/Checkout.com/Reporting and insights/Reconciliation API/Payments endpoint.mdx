The payments endpoint allows you to search for all payments within parameters you specify.

The payments endpoint is not available in the sandbox environment.

If you're not familiar with creating API requests, you might want to take a look at our [Postman guide](/display/DOCS/Postman+guide).

No payments from before February 7th, 2019 at 00.00.00 UTC will appear when using the payments endpoint. To view payments from before this time, please [contact our Support team](mailto:support@checkout.com).

### Understanding the response

The payments endpoint is designed to present your payments as clearly as possible. Depending on your parameters, you may receive a large response. If you’re looking for data even more quickly, try amending the parameters in the request. Regardless of the parameters in your request, the payments endpoint’s response can be split into four sections, each of which is outlined below.

#### 1\. Payments

This section displays all payment information in accordance with your chosen parameters. The table below shows the full list of parameters displayed, and how to decipher them.

|

#### 2\. Actions

This section outlines all the actions — authorization, void, capture, refund, retrieval, and chargeback — which have been administered to a payment. The table below outlines and explains the parameters of the report.

|

#### 3\. Breakdown

The amounts summary shows the amounts corresponding with a particular action. The table below shows the full list of these parameters and their explanations.

|

If you're looking for the outcome of a particular chargeback, please allow up to 60 days from the date the evidence was provided.

#### 4\. Links

You might have noticed several links at the bottom of the response from the payments endpoint. Let’s take a look at each one.

##### Payment ID – Self

This link allows you to focus on a particular payment that has been included in the response. As you can see, the final component of the link is `pay_sv6ikhu36mgepkm3l22pztvywa`, which corresponds to the payment ID for that particular payment in the response.

    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "http://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments/pay_sv6ikhu36mgepkm3l22pztvywa"
      }
    }

##### Next

This link lets you move to the next page of results. Results are paginated at a payment level. By default, a page contains 200 results — though you can [change this limit](#Paymentsendpoint-limitresults) if you'd like.

    "_links": {
      "next": {
        "href": "http://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?from=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&to=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&limit=1&after=11111111"
      }
    }

##### Self

This link provides the URL associated with the current request.

    "_links": {
      "self": {
        "href": "http://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?from=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&to=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&limit=1"
      }
    }

Download a CSV
--------------

In addition to the JSON format described above, you can download a CSV report containing the data from the payments endpoint. To do this, follow the steps below.

### How to download the CSV file

In the URL for the payments endpoint, add `/download` after `/payments`. An example of this can be found below:

    https://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments/download?from={start-date-time}&to={end-date-time}

  
If you are using Postman or an equivalent application, rather than sending the GET request, use the **Send and Download** functionality for the GET request to download the CSV report.

Using `/download` will return a CSV containing all your payments unlike a standard request, which is paginated.

You can also get a CSV report by amending the Headers section of the request to accept a value of `text/csv`. Note that this will contain the same paginated results as the JSON.

### How to read the CSV file

In your CSV file, a single payment is uniquely identified by an ID in the first column of the table and will be made of multiple rows, each of them reflecting a fee or an amount applied to a different action within the payment lifecycle. 

Regardless of the parameters in your request, the payments endpoint’s CSV file will have the same overall structure and columns titles which can be split into three sections.

#### 1\. Payment and card attributes

This section displays all payment and card attributes in accordance with your chosen parameters.

#### 2\. Actions

This section outlines all the actions — authorization, void, capture, refund and chargeback — which have been administered to a payment.

![](/download/attachments/2785479/actions.png?version=1&modificationDate=1586269257664&api=v2)

#### 3\. Breakdown

This section provides details of the associated amounts to an action in both the processing and the payout currencies.

Limit results 
--------------

Responses from the payments endpoint can be large, depending on the number of payments you process and the parameters you have chosen. By default, each page includes 200 results.

To limit your results, add `limit=` followed by a number of your choice (up to 500) at the end of the URL.

For example:

    http://api.checkout.com/reporting/payments?from=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&to=01%2F03%2F2019%2000%3A00%3A00&limit=100

You can only limit results for JSON responses. A CSV will always contain all possible results.
