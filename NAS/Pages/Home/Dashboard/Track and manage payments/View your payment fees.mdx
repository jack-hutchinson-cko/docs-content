When you process a payment with us, there are certain fees you will be charged along the payment lifecycle. You can see the breakdown of these charges in your Dashboard by navigating to the Payment details page.

From your Dashboard home page: 

1.  Click _Payments_ in the left-hand menu.
    
2.  Click on the payment you would like to see the fee breakdown for. This takes you to the 'Payments details' page. 
    
3.  Scroll to the 'Payment fees' section.

Payment fee breakdown
---------------------

In the 'Payment fees' section, you will see 'Scheme and other network fees' and 'Checkout fees'. Checkout fees are a total sum of fees incurred along the payment lifecycle. When you expand this, you'll see a breakdown of the types of fees grouped by categories.

We display your fees per category at payment level in the currency of your bank account. If you are seeking to reconcile your fees by financial actions, rather than payments, we advise you to refer to the settlement CSV report.

As the fees are aggregated at the payment level, they can change over time as your payment passes through the different stages of the payment lifecycle. For example, if your payment is refunded then any associated fees will be reflected in the 'Payment fees' section.
