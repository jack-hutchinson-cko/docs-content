## About user roles

The Dashboard has eight pre-defined user roles:

- Administrator Owner
- Administrator
- Developer
- Disputes Manager
- Disputes Operator
- Support Manager
- Read Only

The Administrator Owner is the overall owner for the account.

Each role comes with its own set of permissions, as described in the table below:

## Manage your users

Administrators (including the Owner) have access to the *User management* screen (under **Settings**), which provides a record of all users on an account. Depending on your entity access, the list on view will filter to reflect the users whose details you can edit, depending on your business needs. The Administrator Owner can view and manage all users for all entities on the account.

### View users

The \_User managemen_t screen provides a view of all users at a glance, including their roles and user status.

The _Last login_ column reflects the three possible user statuses:

- `PENDING`: the user has recently been invited to your platform and is yet to accept the invitation and set up their login details. Users have seven days to accept an invitation before it expires.
- `[Timestamp]`: the user has accepted the invitation. The date and timestamp on view show the last time the user accessed the platform.
- `EXPIRED`: the user has failed to accept the invitation in time and the token has expired.

To view more information or edit a user's details, click on a row. The details pane opens on the right side of the page:

### Add a user

You can add as many users to your Dashboard as you require. A user’s email, name, and role are all mandatory, as well as the entities you want them to have access to.
. In _Settings > User management_, click **Add user**. A pop-up opens.![](/download/attachments/8489325/Add%20user.png?version=1&modificationDate=1604507203790&api=v2) 2. Enter the user's _Email_, _First name_, and _Last name_. 3. Select the _Role_ you want the user to have. By default, this is set to Read Only. 4. Tick the *Legal entities* you want the user to have access to.

    You can only assign a user to the entities that you have access to. Once added, another Administrator can amend the user’s access if required.

. Click **Add user**.

A confirmation message pops up and the new user is added to the bottom of the list on the \_User managemen_t screen.  
![](/download/attachments/8489325/Pending%20user.png?version=2&modificationDate=1604677811206&api=v2)

The new user has a `PENDING` status. When they activate their account, this will be replaced with a timestamp.

### Edit a user

Edit an existing user's role and entity access.
. In *Settings > User management*, click on a user. The details pane opens on the right side of your screen. 2. Use the _Role_ drop-down to update a user's role. 3. Tick or untick the _Legal entities_ you want the user to have access to. 4. Click **Save** to confirm.

The user's details are updated.

### Delete a user

Delete a user to revoke all their access rights and completely remove them from the platform.
. In *Settings > User management*, click on a user. The details pane opens on the right side of your screen. 2. In the top right of the details pane, click **Delete user**. 3. To confirm, click **Delete user** again.  
 ![](/download/attachments/8489325/Delete%20user%20-%20Confirm.png?version=1&modificationDate=1605268169178&api=v2)

A confirmation message pops up and the user is removed from the _User management_ screen.

### Transfer ownership to another user

If you are the Administrator Owner, you can transfer the ownership of the entire account over to another user—as long as they are an Administrator.

Transferring ownership to another user grants them access to all the entities on the account.
. In *Settings > User management*, click on a user. The details pane opens on the right side of your screen. 2. In the top right of the details pane, click **Transfer ownership**. Note that this button is only visible to the Administrator Owner.  3. Enter your password. 4. To confirm, click **Transfer ownership** again. A confirmation messages pops up. The chosen user's role is updated to Administrator Owner (`Owner`). Your role is updated to Administrator (`Admin`).
