Find out more about the Dashboard and what it can do for you.

Log in
======

There are two possible ways to log in to the Dashboard:

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

If you have an [Okta](https://www.okta.com/products/single-sign-on/) account, and you have the Dashboard assigned to it, you can log in using SSO. Follow our [initial](/four/dashboard/get-started/initial-client-okta-setup) and [final](/four/dashboard/get-started/final-client-okta-setup-and-testing) setup guides to set up SSO.

### Credentials

If you don't have an SSO account, you can log in with your email address and a password.

  

Navigate the Dashboard
======================

Getting around your Dashboard is easy—just click an icon in the sidebar to access the corresponding screen.

Business entity selector
------------------------

If you have multiple business entities, your Dashboard will combine and display the data for all of them by default. To view data related to a specific entity, click the drop-down menu in the top left and choose one.

The Home page
=============

_Home_ is the first thing you see when you log in to the Dashboard. It gives you a concise view of all your payments activity, allowing you to check how your business is doing at a glance.  

Track and analyze your volume, refund and disputes metrics in real-time, and see a detailed breakdown of volume for each card type, payment method and currency you support.

Display currency and timezone

You cannot change the display currency from the default currency you chose when setting up your Checkout.com account. The timezone is determined by your internet browser settings, which will filter through to the reports in the _Datetime Local_ column.

Date selector
-------------

By default, the _Home_ page displays data from the last two weeks.

If you want to view older data, click **Date filter** in the top right and then select a date or date range. To select a date range, click on the start date then click on the end date. Your selected date range will be highlighted in green.
