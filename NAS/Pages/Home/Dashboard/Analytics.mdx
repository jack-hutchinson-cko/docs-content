Data explorer
-------------

Use _Data explorer_ to build charts and deep dive into payment analytics.

### Chart builder

Choose from a variety of data types, such as authorization rate, and visualizations, like bar and donut charts.

#### Data type

When creating a chart, start by selecting the 'Data type' under the heading 'Chart data'. That data type should be the main metric that you would like to analyze. You can choose from count, amount, rates and calculation-based data types.

For example, if you would like to analyze your organization's authorizations, you can choose from either 'Authorized count' or 'Authorized amount'. 'Authorized count' indicates the **number of** authorizations across the select range. 'Authorized amount' indicates the **total value** of the authorizations.

#### Group by

The 'Group by' selector under the ‘Chart data’ heading determines how you would like to measure your chosen data type. For example grouping by currency or card scheme.

If you do not use a group by, you will only view a specific number or rate for your data type. Select _\+ Group by_ to group by an additional dimension. Select _Remove_ next to a group by to clear your group by selection.

#### Limits

When you select your desired group by, you may be given the option to limit the data points. This is useful when you have a lot of data points and wish to limit the results shown on the chart.

The limit filter is not available when using the 'Creation date' and 'Decline type' group by selectors, or when more than one group by selectors have been applied.

#### Filter

Filtering let you be more specific with your data explorations. You can decide whether you want your chart to include (=) or not include (!=) your filter. You can add multiple filters by using the 'and' or 'or' operands.

#### Chart types

As you start to select your variables, your chart will start to take shape. You can change how you want to view your data by selecting a chart type. The chart types available are depended on the 'Data type' and 'Group by' you have selected.

Charts are interactive – meaning you can hover, highlight and zoom to dig deeper into your chart's data.

#### Data range

Use the date picker to choose what time span you would like your chart's data to display. If you wish to see hourly data points for a particular day, select the date range of one day.

#### Code viewer

Code viewer allows you to view the query behind your chart.

### Saving a chart

If you would like to save a chart for future reference, you can do so by saving the chart to a board. 

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-6hVqLKzbKpsCAxtNbZ9TqtSogmUI4iRLVRn0bfDbipshExXOOCpVIw9DmbGZoeflKJRUptOwRgruGMY1OWdwdq6xcZoCi87AicUtzahLoh5ehmhPQnxcxqNe2W0vknuRSBDIJ_y)

When you select _Save chart_, you will be prompted to enter a chart title and an optional chart description. Choose an existing board you would like to save the chart to, or select _\+ Create a new board_ to save a brand-new board.

Boards
------

Boards are used to organize relevant charts in the same space for easy access. Create multiple boards to organize your charts and keep track of the metrics most important to you and your team members. 

### My boards and shared boards

Boards can either be private for only you to see in your 'My boards' list, or shared for other members in your organization to view. This is set when you first create your board, but can also be changed at any time from your board's settings. When you make a board shared, the board will be available to access for users from within your entity.

Making boards shared is a useful way to ensure that work is not duplicated across your team by letting other users have access to your board.

### Preset boards

The 'Preset boards' tab displays a list of example boards created by [Checkout.com](http://Checkout.com), available to all users. Use these preset boards as inspiration to create your own, or to provide quick insight into your payments data without having to create a board yourself.

### Create a new board

You can create a new board by selecting _\+ New board_ on the boards page. 

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6euKZX7xZfzbqKRKCRL7ymRVI6d__q8F8cjrKRCIhFWmvR02GAR2UPRmymQEyh_JgwcJTDebUA3D3nbZ-i5VBb-EmPkTBr6xYBgNdWHnz6XeZIZJxouqoGo_d7B1opkPI5mrtF9I)

You must enter a board title and decide whether you want your board to be shared or private before saving. These settings can be edited at any time in your board settings.

### Add widgets to your boards

When you have created a new board, you will need to add charts to start analyzing payments data.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qDXNiQf8tDBiqm5LMtM3g08Gy-Rs7RdiKKh1b2M18bZl9fo8apwbiOym8LWWbv7Tvd2kK2rvyd4UtgXzd-2rPErcgiXAKm9tIwjt8mz_prTwQ8h8SJGlcJBC-pqVDFQwQCdCt2z)

#### Add a chart

Adding a chart to your board can be done in two ways: 

1.  After creating a chart in _Data explorer_ and selecting _Save chart_.
2.  Directly from the board by selecting _\+ New widget / + New chart_.

When adding a chart directly from your board, you will be navigated through the 'Chart builder', just as you have seen in the 'Data explorer'.

#### Add a tile separator

A tile separator is a customizable text box widget, which enables you to organize your board. The example below shows the use of a tile separator ‘Acceptance rate’, which groups charts related to acceptance rates metrics.

### Edit widgets

#### Edit chart data

Editing a chart can be done by hovering and selecting the setting's icon on the chart you wish to edit. From here, you will be able to edit the chart data, title and description, and delete the chart.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/h2J5f3yPISG8B1ESRDfWGF5sRcoorO58if9jTegyYxNP4_hIywQVEpGoG1zx_Yn2rfShcWxg71AFzMCNEFrhS1jlAiI-hbC7KhfUeOJrvyEu5lonyWyVtJbZ8g6ivrDj2ydvDYs8)

#### Edit a widget's size

You can adjust the size of a widget by using the toggle in the bottom of the right-hand corner of your widget. Drag this until the widget is the size you like.

#### Move widgets 

Move a widget by clicking on the title of the widget and dragging it to the desired area of your board. Your widget's new position will be automatically saved when it has been moved.

### Edit boards

Editing a board can be done by selecting the setting's icon next to the date range selector. From here, you will be able to edit the board information and delete the board.

You can switch between your client entities to see the data in the board reflect your chosen entity's data
