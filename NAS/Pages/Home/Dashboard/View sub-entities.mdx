Once you have been onboarded to our Marketplaces solution, you are able to view your sub-entities and their capabilities through the Dashboard.

Use these guides to support your learning:

*   [The Dashboard at a glance](/display/x/The+Dashboard+at+a+glance)
    
*   [Marketplaces documentation](/display/AR/Marketplaces)
    

Before you begin
----------------

*   Make sure your [user has permission](/display/x/User+roles+and+management) to view sub-entities by being assigned one of the roles: owner, administrator, support manager, disputes manager and read only.
    
*   Make sure your user has access to a legal entity that has been configured to onboard sub-entities.

Once you select _Sub-entities,_ you will see: 

*   Sub-entity trading name
*   Sub-entity payment capabilities (either enabled or disabled)
*   Last modified

The information displayed here reflects the actions made with the Marketplace API during your integration with Checkout.com. For a reminder about when payment capabilities change, see our onboarding page.

There are different sub-entity views depending on how much you want to drill down into your client-entities.

*   [**Top-level account view**](#tabs-25d9356a-6ce8-45dc-b6c9-fbd9fa53e705-1)
*   [**Legal entity view**](#tabs-25d9356a-6ce8-45dc-b6c9-fbd9fa53e705-2)
*   [**Legal entity not using Marketplaces view**](#tabs-25d9356a-6ce8-45dc-b6c9-fbd9fa53e705-3)

1.  Select the top-level account from the business entity selector on the top-left of the screen.
2.  The sub-entity table will display **all** sub-entities under your account. If you have access to multiple entities who can onboard sub-entities, you will see all the sub-entities here.

1.  Select the legal entity from the business entity selector on the top-left of the screen.
2.  The sub-entity table will display **only** the sub-entities under that legal entity.

If one of your legal entities hasn’t been set up to onboard sub-entities, you will see the screen message: ‘This entity isn’t using Marketplaces yet’.

Sub-entity search and filter
----------------------------

At both the top-level and legal entity view, you are able to search and filter through your sub-entities using the search bar. 

Upon entering the search bar, you are presented with options in a very similar way to the existing [payments filter and search functionality](/display/x/Filter+payments).

You can see the following example where a search and filter on the trading name field has been performed:
