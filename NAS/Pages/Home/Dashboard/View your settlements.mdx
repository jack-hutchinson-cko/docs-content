[Go to start of metadata](#page-metadata-start)

At the end of a settlement cycle, we display a list of payments made to your account in the Dashboard. To view your settlements from the landing page, click Settlements in the left-hand menu.

How settlements are calculated

We calculate the settlement amount by looking at the amounts processed during that period.

The ‘Settlements’ page shows a list of these settlements, ordered from the most recent (at the top of the page) to the oldest. For each settlement, you will see:

*   Amount.
    
*   Status: This will be REJECTED, PENDING or COMPLETED. 
    
*   Reference.
    
*   Billing descriptor: This is the reference to the specific settlement, and what you will see on your bank statement. 
    
*   Payout ID: You can use this ID as an additional identifier; however, this is given by Checkout.com and applies to us only.
    
*   Settlement date: If the payment has not been settled yet, we indicate the expected date.

Settlement details page

Navigate to the ‘Settlement details’ page by clicking on a specific settlement from the main list. Here you’ll see more details about that payout, such as:

*   What stages the settlement has been through.
    
*   Bank account details.
    
*   The balance day and time for that settlement.

Transactions breakdown
----------------------

At the bottom of the ‘Settlement details’ page, you’ll see ‘Transactions breakdown’. Here you can download a report of [financial actions by payout ID](/display/x/Financial+actions+reports), which gives a breakdown of transactions for that particular settlement. 

We provide a lot of granular details in our report, so if the report is too big, we will break this down into several reports, so it’s more digestible.
