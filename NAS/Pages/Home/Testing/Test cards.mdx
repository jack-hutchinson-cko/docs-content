## Commercial cards

You can use these cards to trigger a fallback to 3DS1. A fallback occurs when the cardholder or issuer is not using 3DS2.

Using these cards in a [Sessions](/display/x/Sessions) direct integration and in combination with the ‘magic amount’ (123321) will trigger a very specific scenario.

A fallback to 3DS1 will be triggered after the merchant initiated a 3DS2 that failed during the first authentication call (e.g. for the reasons of technical issue or a timeout on the side of the ACS).
