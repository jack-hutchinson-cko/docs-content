Hosted sessions are the simplest solution for authenticating transactions with 3D Secure.

Start a session and then redirect the customer using the link in the response. We'll gather the necessary payment, device and cardholder data and take care of the rest.

Hosted sessions are suitable for authentications initiated from **browsers only**.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "sid_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb441",
      "transaction_id": "9aea641d-0549-4222-9ca9-d90b43a4f38c",
      "amount": 120,
      "currency": "USD",
      "authentication_type": "regular",
      "authentication_category": "payment",
      "status": "pending",
      "next_actions": [
        "redirect_cardholder"
      ],
      "protocol_version": "2.2.0",
      "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89",
      "_links": {
        "redirect": {
          "href": "http://3ds2.checkout.com/interceptor/sid_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44"
        },
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.checkout.com/sessions/sid_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb441"
        }
      }
    }

Step 2: Redirect the customer 
------------------------------

Redirect the customer using the `_links.redirect` URL you received in the response.

In the background, our Sessions API will then gather the device data, perform a challenge (if required), and authenticate the payment. After authentication is completed, your customer will be redirected to your `success_url` or `failure_url`. You can now continue to authorize the payment via our Payments API.

If the authentication is approved or attempted, the customer will be redirected to your success URL. All other authentication results will redirect the customer to your failure URL.

### Session properties

#### Session statuses 

Below are the possible values of the `status` field, which tell you the current status of the session.

Status

Description

Status

Description

`pending`

Authentication has been requested and the session has been started. The session `id` is passed back to your server and can be shared with the mobile app (iOS or Android) SDK.

`processing`

The 3DS server has updated the authentication with channel data collected by the SDKs and has created and sent an authentication request to the directory server. The access control server is now evaluating the data to decide whether to authenticate the transaction (frictionless) or challenge it.

`approved`

The payment has been successfully authenticated (frictionless or challenged).

`attempted`

The payment has not been successfully authenticated, because the access control server could not be reached, but proof of the attempted authentication is provided (frictionless).

`unavailable`

Authentication failed because of technical problems with the directory server or the issuer's access control server.

`declined`

The transaction was not authenticated. The issuer denied the transaction.

`rejected`

The transaction was rejected. The issuer is rejecting the authentication and requests that authorisation not be attempted.

`challenged`

Authentication has been requested but the issuer requires that the cardholder be presented with a challenge.

`challenge_abandoned`

Authentication has been started and challenged, but the cardholder did not complete the challenge.

`expired`

Authentication has been started but the channel data could not be collected, meaning an authentication request was not created.

### Next actions 

Below are the possible values for the `next_actions` field. When present, they identify what action to take in order to complete the session.

Session type

Hosted

`redirect_cardholder`
