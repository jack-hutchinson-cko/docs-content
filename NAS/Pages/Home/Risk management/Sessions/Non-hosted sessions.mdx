For full control over your 3D Secure authentication flow, use non-hosted sessions. These will be initiated by your backend.

Non-hosted sessions are suitable for authentications initiated for both **browsers and mobile apps**.

Authenticating your requests
----------------------------

#### Access tokens

All Sessions API endpoints will accept a valid JSON web token (JWT) bearer token. These short-lived tokens can be generated using your client id and secret, which you will have received when you created your account.

Tokens must contain the scope `sessions:browser` for browser channel flows or `sessions:app` for native mobile app channel flows. If you are unsure of the channel you're going to use when you request the session, you can include both scopes.

#### Session secret

All endpoints following the request to create a new session will also accept the session secret; creating a session will return a `session_secret` property, which can be used in the Authorization header of subsequent requests for that session. 

The `session_secret` is short-lived randomly generated string that can only be used for actions taken on a specific session, reducing the chance of it being leaked. This way the frontend does not have to have access to the client secrets required to create JWT tokens (which, if exposed to the frontend, can risk being leaked to malicious third parties).

Note that any endpoint accessible with `session_secret` can also be accessed with a valid JWT token. This can be useful if you intend to access the endpoints from your backend, for instance, because you proxy the requests instead of making them directly from the frontend.

Step 1: Request a session 
--------------------------

This is the first step to starting a 3DS authentication flow with Sessions. Authenticate the call with an access token and perform it from your backend.

#### The response

You will get a response with the property `next_actions`, which will tell you what you need to do next.

Field name

Description

Field name

Description

`id`

STRING

The unique identifier of the session.

`next_actions`

ARRAY

Specifies what action to take to complete the session. Will be one of: `collect_channel_data`, `issuer_fingerprint` (browser-initiated only), `challenge_cardholder`, or `complete`.

[See below for all possible actions and their meanings](#Non-hostedsessions-actions).

`status`

STRING

The status of the session. Should be `pending`.

[See below for all possible statuses and their meanings](#Non-hostedsessions-statuses).

Step 3: Issuer fingerprint (browser only) 
------------------------------------------

If one of the next actions after creating the session was `issuer_fingerprint`, this step must be completed before proceeding with the session.

This involves the customer's browser contacting the Access Control Server directly so that the latter can calculate a fingerprint of it.

### Create payload

To do this, you first need to construct the following payload:

    {
      "threeDSServerTransID": //the transaction_id property of the session,
      "threeDSMethodNotificationURL": //the URL that will receive the 3DS method notification message
    }

This payload needs to be base64 encoded and sent to the `three_ds_method_url` property of the `_links` object of the session using a POST request and putting the base64 encoded data in a form field called `threeDSMethodData`.

### Redirect

This will trigger a POST redirect to the `threeDSMethodNotificationURL` with a form parameter named `threeDSMethodData`. This will be a base64 encoded payload that, when decoded, will look like the following:

    {
      "threeDSServerTransID": //the transaction_id property of the session
    }

If you do not wish to handle the notification manually you can use our interceptor application to do it for you. To do so, set the `threeDSMethodNotificationURL` with the applicable endpoint:

*   [**Live**](#tabs-b61f1942-d559-4e41-8da2-df95d09468d2-1)
*   [**Sandbox**](#tabs-b61f1942-d559-4e41-8da2-df95d09468d2-2)

POST`https://3ds2.checkout.com/interceptor/3ds-method-notification`

POST`https://3ds2-sandbox.ckotech.co/interceptor/3ds-method-notification`

### Notification of completion

After you POST the `threeDSMethodData`, you can be notified about the completion by listening for a browser event as follows:

    window.addEventListener("message", messageCallback, false);

Where `messageCallback` is a function with the following signature:

    function messageCallback(event){
      console.log(event.data)
    }

And `event.data` will contain the following object:

    {
      “threeDSServerTransID”: //the transaction_id property of the session
    }

### Fingerprint completed

Once you've received the message, the fingerprint has completed successfully and you can set the `three_ds_method_completion` property to `Y`.

If you don't receive the message within 10 seconds of initiating the flow, you can set this property to N. If there is no 3DS method URL available, set it to `U`. You submit that property as detailed [here](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Sessions/paths/~1sessions~1%7Bid%7D~1issuer-fingerprint/put).

The issuer fingerprint part of the flow can be combined with collecting the channel data (see below). Specifically, if you have completed the fingerprint with the ACS, you can add the `three_ds_method_completion` status as detailed above to the payload of collect channel data which will perform both actions at once.

Step 4: Collect channel data 
-----------------------------

Once you've completed the relevant actions indicated by the `next_actions` property, you need to update the session with the collected device data to make the authentication request.

If you created the session with channel data, there is no need to complete this step. This step will be handled by our mobile SDKs for mobile app flows.

Step 5 a: 3DS2 (browser only) 
------------------------------

This is only relevant for browser-based authentications. Our mobile SDKs will handle the challenge flow for mobile app authentications.

If, after completing the issuer fingerprint and channel data steps, the authentication is approved/declined immediately—the "frictionless" flow—you can proceed to [complete the session](#Non-hostedsessions-completesession).

If not, the cardholder will now be challenged to provide additional information to authenticate the payment—the "challenge" flow.

        }
      }
    }

#### Create challenge request

The `next_actions` field will contain the `challenge_cardholder` action (see example above). To proceed, create the challenge request (CReq) message as follows:

    {
      "threeDSServerTransID": //the transaction_id field of the session,
      "acsTransID": //the acs.transaction_id field of the session,
      "messageType":"CReq",
      "messageVersion": //the specific 3DS version used. Should be set to the protocol_version property of the session,
      "challengeWindowSize": //the requested challenge size. See below for possible values
    }

The style of the challenge window style is dependent on the issuer, so the above sizes may not be exact. We recommend that you render the challenge inside a frame so you have full control over the final size on your page.

#### Render the challenge

Once the CReq message is constructed, it needs to be base64 encoded and posted to the `acs.url` property of the session in a form field named `creq`. If successful, the response will be the HTML needed to render the challenge.

      </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/3ds2simulator/js/main.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

  

The challenge is dependent on the card issuer, so the actual HTML may look different, but there should be a form for the cardholder to complete the challenge.  

### Notification of outcome

If you want to be notified about the completion of the challenge, you can register an event handler on your page as follows:

    window.addEventListener("message", messageCallback, false);

Where `messageCallback` is a function with the following signature:

    function messageCallback(event){
      console.log(event.data)
    }

And `event.data` will contain the following object:

    {
      "transStatus": "Y",
      "threeDSServerTransID": "352455b7-b3b1-4696-a916-69e2e4274e6c"
    }

Where `threeDSServerTransID` is the `transaction_id` of the session and `transStatus` is one of the following values:

Value

Description

Value

Description

`Y`

Authentication/Verification Successful

`N`

Not Authenticated/Account Not Verified (transaction denied)

`U`

Authentication/Account Verification Could Not Be Performed (a technical or other problem, as indicated in ARes or RReq)

`A`

Attempts Processing Performed (not authenticated/verified, but a proof of attempted authentication/verification is provided)

`R`

Authentication/Account Verification Rejected (issuer has rejected transaction)

### Challenge completed

Once the challenge has been completed, the session should move to a final state, allowing you to (optionally) complete the session.

At this point the session should contain the `eci` and `cryptogram` (CAVV/AVV) properties needed for authorization, but these will only be returned when retrieving the session using a JWT token and not the `session_secret`. This is to protect them from leaking to the client side.

  

The challenge flow should be completed within 10 minutes of initiating the flow. If this is not the case, the status of the challenge can be set to `U`.

Step 5 b: 3DS1 challenge (browser only)
---------------------------------------

This is only relevant for browser-based authentications.

If you have 3DS protocol 1.0.2 enabled for processing, there is a chance your session will be downgraded from 3DS2 to 3DS1. This can happen because the card or the issuer was not enrolled for 3DS2, your processor is only set up for 3DS1, or there was an issue while communicating with the 3DS2 Directory Server. 

Depending on the specific scenario, this can happen:

*   Immediately after creating the session
    
*   After collecting browser data and performing the issuer fingerprint, so essentially instead of a 3DS2 challenge described above.
    

When this downgrade happens your session will typically look like this:

    {
      "id": "sid_czh2caqsczxufdjpgojfop3upy",
      "transaction_id": "02a14f16-1612-426f-8d2f-3392573f747e",
      "amount": 10,
      "currency": "USD",
      "completed": false,
      "authentication_type": "regular",
      "authentication_category": "payment",
      "status": "challenged",
      "protocol_version": "1.0.2",
      "next_actions": [
        "authenticate"
      ],
      "challenged": true,
      "transaction_type": "goods_service",
      "session_secret": "sek_PEX6+C6bwZiLbYauPEuN6ix4fyhKvl9l7gV9mVrNX3U=",
      "scheme": "visa",
      "pareq": "eJyNVNtSqzAUffcrMrw6kBuFthPiVDsdq9ZLb0cfEUJhFFoDaPXrDWnrnDNHJbzATtba7LVv7GSbP4NXIctsXQQWdpAFRBGt46xYBdZiPrK71gk%2fAv8%2fbJ5KIYYzEdVSfIvQqIkoy3AlQBYHFiIhdhPs2djDxHaJl9jdmCQ2pT3S8Wniu76wfnSl3d0OpuLlV4iG7QVxpcchDB7MVt5EyCgNi6oVqdFh9HI6vubU9%2f0OYnBvGlFzIcdDjg4PQS6lPoO7YyMPRZgLnu%2fjBcusDAGNS0AcFYm%2bM%2fISreuiku%2b8SzwGD4YRs5bPPK2qTdmHUL%2brsHLqEhKkAmguW5MNjbPNbusGWRqK2mYxHz0dp4N0%2fOcRXV5ffdzMlh89lOSjPMaTgMEGYeQqDivBiaoP6hIf4E6foj7qMajPzZokb7LKkYPBYjZUXbKzjbibRvZgR8AqrX%2fbZuWtpVTjrOrrKvqXZcQV2826EOpPaoC%2bvtuLalwqdnZuOmZRpaYCXixPp9HD%2bXzp3d2vzi7up28iuluMBqunoBk%2bDTJVlqk2R4QiLS0z6HkGW8JVyn%2fdTU2761X4%2fTaF%2f6zTT1fXJcw%3d",
      "xid": "Fk+hAhIWb0KNLzOSVz90fmFmd1M=",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://3ds2.ckotech.co/sessions/sid_czh2caqsczxufdjpgojfop3upy"
         },
         "acs_url": {
           "href": "https://3ds2.ckotech.co/3ds1simulator/visa/ds/challenge?p=4484070000035519"
         },
         "term_url": {
           "href": "https://3ds2.ckotech.co/sessions/sid_czh2caqsczxufdjpgojfop3upy/pares"
         }
        }
    }

The `next_action` is `authenticate` and the protocol version is `1.0.2`. The 3DS1 flow always contains a challenge and the challenge is always browser-based. Let us see how to initiate the challenge.

### Render the challenge

To render the challenge you need to POST the following form fields to the `session._links.acs_url`:

Name

Description

Name

Description

`MD`

The `session.transation_id`.

`TermUrl`

The URL for the handler that will receive the PaRes (Payer Authentication Response) message. We recommend using s`ession._links.term_url` for this if you do not wish to build your own handler, but you can also receive the message on your end and forward it to our `term_url`.

`PaReq`

The Payer Authentication Request (`session.pareq`). This is the base64 and URL-encoded payload to send to the ACS.

  

The above fields can be case-sensitive depending on the ACS, so please make sure to follow the casing shown.

The result of this POST will be the challenge form. Once the cardholder completes this successfully, the `TermUrl` will receive the `PaRes` (Payer Authentication Response) and the outcome of that will be rendered in place of the challenge (see next section).

### Notification of outcome

If you want to be notified about the completion of the challenge, you can register an event handler on your page as follows:

    window.addEventListener("message", messageCallback, false);
    Where messageCallback is a function with the following signature:
    function messageCallback(event){
      console.log(event.data)
    }

  

`event.data` will contain the following object:

  

    {
      "status": "approved",
      "transaction_id": "352455b7-b3b1-4696-a916-69e2e4274e6c"
    }

  

Where `transaction_id` is the transaction ID of the session and `status` is the final status of the session based on the outcome of the challenge.

  

If an unexpected error occurred during the validation of the PaRes, the event data will look like this instead:

    {
      "request_id":"0HM2GJLG46GM1:00000001",
      "error_type":"operation_not_allowed",
      "error_codes":["update_not_allowed_due_to_state"]
    }

Similar to an error Sessions API would respond with.  

### Challenge completed

Once the 3DS1 challenge has been completed, the session should move to a final state, allowing you to (optionally) complete the session.

At this point the session should contain the `eci`, `xid`, and `cryptogram` (CAVV/AVV) properties needed for authorization, but these will only be returned when retrieving the session using a JWT token and not the `session_secret`. This is to protect them from leaking to the client side.

  

The challenge flow should be completed within 10 minutes of initiating the flow. If this is not the case, the status of the session will be set to `challenge_abandoned`.

Step 6: Complete session (optional)
-----------------------------------

This is an optional step providing an easy way for you to be notified about the completion of the authentication.

Once the session is in a final state (approved, declined, rejected, unavailable, or attempted), you can choose to complete it.

This triggers a POST to the `completion.callback_url` field of the session and will respond with `204` if the call was successful or `500` otherwise. Alternatively, you can GET the session details to inspect it and verify its final status.

#### Header and path parameters

Header

Value

Header

Value

`Authorization`

REQUIRED

`session_secret`

Use the secret key (prefixed by `sek_`) you received in the [create session response](#Non-hostedsessions-createresponse).

  

Path

Value

Path

Value

`id`

REQUIRED

The session ID, prefixed by `sid_`.

#### The response

If successful, we will use the `callback_url` to share the authentication outcome with you (see example below). If we receive a `2XX` response from you, you will then get a successful `204` response with no content. If the payment was authenticated, you're now ready to authorize and complete the payment.

If the authentication is approved (`“response_code”: “Y”`) or attempted (`“A”`), you can authorize the payment. If the authentication is unavailable due to technical issues (`“U”`), you can decide whether or not to proceed with the payment, based on your risk assessment.

### Session properties

#### Session statuses 

Below are the possible values of the `status` field, which tell you the current status of the session.

Status

Description

Status

Description

`pending`

Authentication has been requested and the session has been started. The session `id` is passed back to your server and can be shared with the mobile app (iOS or Android) SDK.

`processing`

The 3DS server has updated the authentication with channel data collected by the SDKs and has created and sent an authentication request to the directory server. The access control server is now evaluating the data to decide whether to authenticate the transaction (frictionless) or challenge it.

`approved`

The payment has been successfully authenticated (frictionless or challenged).

`attempted`

The payment has not been successfully authenticated, because the access control server could not be reached, but proof of the attempted authentication is provided (frictionless).

`unavailable`

Authentication failed because of technical problems with the directory server or the issuer's access control server.

`declined`

The transaction was not authenticated. The issuer denied the transaction.

`rejected`

The transaction was rejected. The issuer is rejecting the authentication and requests that authorisation not be attempted.

`challenged`

Authentication has been requested but the issuer requires that the cardholder be presented with a challenge.

`challenge_abandoned`

Authentication has been started and challenged, but the cardholder did not complete the challenge.

`expired`

Authentication has been started but the channel data could not be collected, meaning an authentication request was not created.

#### Next actions 

Below are the possible values for the `next_actions` field. When present, they identify what action to take in order to complete the session.

Session type

Action

Description

Channel

Non-hosted

`collect_channel_data`

Indicates that the SDK should collect the device data and pass it to the Sessions API so that the 3DS server can create an authentication request.

Browser and app

`issuer_fingerprint`

The issuer fingerprint is a step where the 3DS Method URL is used by the access control server before the authentication request to gather additional browser information to perform the risk assessment of the transaction. The use of the 3DS Method URL is optional.

Browser only

`challenge_cardholder`

This occurs after an issuer decides to challenge an authentication. You should create a challenge request and submit it to the issuer's access control server to obtain the details to render a challenge window for the cardholder to submit their credentials.

Browser and app

Hosted and non-hosted

`complete`

No further actions are required. You can complete the session.

Browser and app

Additional authentication data 
-------------------------------
