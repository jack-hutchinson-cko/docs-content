Our disputes API helps you find out about and act on all of your open disputes within the required timeframe. Together with our webhooks, which help you keep track of each status change of a dispute, you'll be well equipped to handle any disputes that arise.

With our disputes API, you can:

*   [View a list of disputes](#DisputesAPI-getlistofdisputes)
*   [View information about a specific dispute](#DisputesAPI-getdetailsaboutdispute)
*   [Provide evidence](#DisputesAPI-provideevidence)
*   [Accept a dispute](#DisputesAPI-acceptdispute)

  
Dispute reasons
------------------

Most of the time, customers dispute a payment because of fraudulent charges. However, there are many other possible reasons. You can tell why a dispute was raised by looking at the `category` field of the response.

Learn more about the [reasons for disputes and the type of evidence we suggest submitting](/display/x/Disputes) when responding.

Dispute statuses
----------------

Each dispute has an associated `status` that describes which stage of the dispute process it has reached.

If you would like to be notified when the status of a dispute changes, you can use our [webhooks](/display/x/Manage+workflows).

Respond to a dispute
--------------------

In order to win a dispute, you will need to provide relevant evidence to your case. This could be the invoice, the proof of delivery, or even customer communication regarding the payment that was charged back. You can use our API to upload evidence, review this evidence, and submit it when you're ready.

### Provide evidence 

Use the endpoint below to add supporting evidence to a dispute. Note that this only attaches the evidence to the dispute, it does not send it to us. Once ready, you will need to [submit it](#DisputesAPI-submitevidence) to us.

The type of evidence we recommend submitting [depends on the reason for the dispute](/display/x/Disputes).

If you wish to submit files as evidence, you will first need to upload them using the [file uploader API](/display/x/File+uploader). This will give you a file `id` (prefixed by `file_`) which you can then use in your request.
