Full account types can make on-demand payouts directly to the sub-entity's local bank account.

Once you've successfully processed a payment on behalf of the sub-entity, you will have funds that need to be paid out to them. You will also want to collect your platform fees.

On this page, we will walk through the how to pay out to a sub-entity:

*   Retrieve currency account balance
*   Store sub-entity bank account details
*   Make a payout
*   Collect platform fees

Retrieve currency account balance
---------------------------------

We are currently working on exposing real-time currency account balances through an API, and hope to offer this functionality soon.

In the meantime, you can process [balance reports](https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports "https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports") to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) on a daily basis. If you’d like to reconcile transactions for each sub-entity, you can process daily [financial actions](https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports "https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports") reports to retrieve this breakdown.

Create sub-entity payment instrument
------------------------------------

A payment instrument is a set of bank account details securely stored in our vault. Creating an instrument is more secure because it means you don't need to keep entering bank details every time you make a payout.

You need to create a payment instrument so that it can be used as a destination payment when making on-demand payouts directly to your sub-entities.

There are different requirements to include in your request depending on the currency of the bank account. At the moment, you can just send money from the **UK**, but you can make a payout to UK bank accounts and European bank accounts.

You can see the full explanation of the optional fields in our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Instruments). For a UK bank, you **must** include: 

Field name

Description

Field name

Description

`label`

A short description of what the instrument is for.

`type`

`currency`

This is the three-letter ISO currency code of the account's currency. At the moment, this would be GBP or EUR.

See [currency codes](https://docs.checkout.com/four/resources/codes/currency-codes).

`country`

The two-letter ISO country code of where the account is based.

See [country codes](https://docs.checkout.com/four/resources/codes/country-codes).

  
Select the applicable option below to see the additional fields that are required depending on the currency.

If your request is accepted, we will attempt to create a payment instrument asynchronously (behind the scenes) and inform you of the outcome via webhook notification

    {
      "request_id": "71ccac67-5018-4917-9446-f2f6f2b8270e",
      "error_type": "request_invalid",
      "error_codes": [
        "bank_code_invalid"
      ]
    }

#### Webhook notification examples

We've described the different webhook notifications on our [webhook event type page](https://docs.checkout.com/four/workflows/webhook-event-types#Webhookeventtypes-Marketplace).

If successful, we will automatically make the association between this payment instrument and its sub-entity. You can see this association and alternatively retrieve the payment instrument ID by using GET`/marketplace/entities/{id}`:

    {
      "id": "ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli",
      ...,
      "instruments": [

          "label": "Daniel's Donuts Barclays"
        }
      ],
      ...,
    

Make sub-entity payouts
-----------------------

Our Unified Payments API already enables you to make payouts to a sub-entity using the payments endpoint.

Making a payout is very similar to a payment, but there are a few more REQUIRED fields. For a list of all possible fields you can include in a payout, see our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#operation/requestAPaymentOrPayout). Make sure you select `PayoutRequest` to see the correct fields.

For a full walkthough, follow the instructions for our [payments endpoint](https://docs.checkout.com/four/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment), and make sure you include the following fields.

      "status":"Pending",
      "instruction":{
        "value_date":"2021-03-31T01:39:57.0909438Z"

    }

If your payout request is unsuccessful, you will receive an error object in the response containing one or several error codes. Use the drop-down to see a list of possible error codes.

    {
      "request_id": "71ccac67-5018-4917-9446-f2f6f2b8270e",
      "error_type": "processing_error",
      "error_codes": [
        "insufficient_currency_account_balance"
      ]
    }

 Possible error codes

Error code

Description

`source_amount_invalid`

The source amount is invalid.

`{field}_required`

The specified field is required, but has not been provided.

`insufficient_currency_account_balance`

There were not enough funds to make the payout.

 Why is there a 'pay to bank not configured' error when attempting a payout?

This means the processing channel you are using is not configured for pay to bank. Please use another one or get in touch to have it enabled on the one you’re using.

Collect platform fees
---------------------

You collect your platform fees through the same method as making payouts to your sub-entities. The only difference is the `destination.id` field should be your Platform's payment instrument ID. This will have been provided to you during your onboarding with [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com).

#### Request example

    {
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": "GBP",
      "source": {
        "type": "currency_account",
        "id": "ca_e6myfp3ubs3ulk5tve6xx6x2oy"
      },
