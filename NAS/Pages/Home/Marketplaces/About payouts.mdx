#### Scheduled payouts

All funds will be settled to your platform’s designated bank account(s) as per the frequency agreed during onboarding.

The distribution of funds to your sub-entities and collection of fees for your platform are both done outside of our solution.

You can optionally process daily [balance reports](https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports "https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/balance-reports") and [financial actions](https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports "https://docs.checkout.com/four/reporting/reconciliation-reports/financial-actions-reports") reports to retrieve the closing available balance of your currency account(s) and perform reconciliation.

#### Make payouts with Checkout.com

Sub-entity funds will be paid out on-demand by your Platform directly to the bank accounts of your sub-entities. 

Funds are distributed to your sub-entities inside our solution, so sub-entity bank account details must be captured as payment instruments to be later used as the destination in payout requests. 

Platform fees can also be collected by performing on-demand payouts to your own bank account.
