[Go to start of metadata](#page-metadata-start)

This process should be followed for those on the full account type for our marketplaces solution. We have another page for [lite sub-entity onboarding](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20120260).

On this page, we will walk through the complete onboarding of a sub-entity:

*   Onboard a sub-entity
*   Update a sub-entity
*   Retrieve a sub-entity
*   Upload an identity document 
*   Handle due diligence notifications

Before you begin
----------------

[Configure your webhooks](https://docs.checkout.com/four/workflows) and subscribe to:

*   `sub_entity_created`
*   `full_dd_passed` and `full_dd_failed`
*   `payouts_enabled` and `payouts_disabled`
*   `payments_enabled` and `payments_disabled`
*   `status_changed`

To get a detailed view of all required and optional fields, see our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Marketplace/paths/~1marketplace~1entities~1{id}/put).

#### Response examples

*   [**201 - Sub-entity onboard successfully**](#tabs-1a9018c4-1e33-4cb3-bdb5-5e968cb264a1-1)
*   [**409 - Conflict**](#tabs-1a9018c4-1e33-4cb3-bdb5-5e968cb264a1-2)
*   [**422 - Invalid data was sent**](#tabs-1a9018c4-1e33-4cb3-bdb5-5e968cb264a1-3)

A successful response will include a unique sub-entity `id`, which you should store for future requests.

Additionally, the response has the `capabilities` object, which shows you whether the sub-entity’s capabilities are enabled or not. Capabilities only get enabled once specific [due diligence checks](/display/x/About+onboarding) have been run and passed.

        }
      }
    }

 Why haven't my capabilities been enabled?

Capabilities are enabled once due diligence checks have been completed. If you haven't received a webhoook notification – either `{check}_passed` or `{check}_failed` – it is likely there are outstanding requirements due. Please check our [onboarding information page](/display/x/About+onboarding) to confirm you have sent all the required information.

If you have provided all the information, we may be completing a manual review.

The `reference` you provide needs to be unique across all of your sub-entities. If you receive a `409`, you are trying to onboard a sub-entity with a `reference` that has already been used. Try again with another `reference`.

    {
        "_links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "https://marketplace.cko-qa.ckotech.co/entities/ent_lcvk7ay5zcglzvda6n7o5ws2hq"
            }
        }
    }

When you receive a `422`, please check the API request to make sure you've included all of the required values. You can see our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Marketplace/paths/~1marketplace~1entities/post) for a full overview.

 Possible error codes

Name

Descriptions

`profile_mccs_invalid_for_processing_scope`

The MCCs provided for the sub-entity are outside the proecessing scop of its Platform.

`profile_default_holding_currency_invalid_for_currency_scope`

The default holding currency provided for the sub-entity is outside the currency scope of its Platform.

`principal_address_country_invalid_for_processing_scope`

The principal address country provided for the sub-entity is outside the processing scope of its Platform.

`client_entity_cannot_onboard_subentities`

The Platform is not permitted to onboard new sub-entities.

`sub_entity_invalid`

Internal validation error. Please contact us if you receive this.

`company_or_individual_required`

The company or individual object must be supplied in your request.

`<field_name>_invalid`

For example, `legal_name_invalid`, or `profile_urls_0_invalid`.

The specified field does not match the validation policies for minimum or maximum length, or formatting.

The only two exceptions to this are `sub_entity_invalid` and `existing_sub_entity_type_invalid`, which have different causes. See the two rows directly above.

`<field_name>_required`

For example, `legal_name_required` or `representatives_0_first_name_required`.

The specified field is mandatory but was not provided in the request. For example, the field is `null`, contains empty strings, or contains white spaces.

#### Webhook notification example

Once your sub-entity has been successfully created, we will send you a `sub_entity_created` webhook notification, which will look similar to:

    {
      "id": "evt_jqv4f6zedawetlilolhqun6m4m",
      "source": "marketplace",
      "type": "sub_entity_created",

        "sub_entity_id": "ent_gavuonbau65upa75f77rar4yuu",
        "reference": "5uperher01234",
        "legal_name": "Super Hero Masks Inc."
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_jqv4f6zedawetlilolhqun6m4m"
        }
      }
    }

Update a sub-entity
-------------------

Use this endpoint to update all fields under the `contact_details`, `profile`, and `company` objects. To fulfil due diligence requirements, your sub-entity needs to provide identity documents; this endpoint also allows you to add identification documents.

### Add an identification document

Use our [files API](/display/x/Upload+a+file) to upload identity documentation. When you upload a file, the API returns an `id` that represents that file, which you can use to attach identity documentation when creating or updating your sub-entity. 

All you need to include is the `identification.documentation` object in your request, with the following pieces of information:

*   **Type:** Read more about [what types are accepted](/display/x/Upload+a+file).
*   **Front:** Required for **all** identification types. This should be the `id` returned when you uploaded the file.
*   **Back:** Only required if the type is **not** a passport. This should be the `id` returned when you uploaded the file.

Adding a document

Providing an identity document is the last step before triggering due diligence checks. To prevent multiple due diligence checks, please add all representatives before uploading their identification documents.

---------------------

If you need to retrieve a sub-entity's details, you can use our Get sub-entity details endpoint. Just include the `id` of the sub-entity returned during the initial onboarding in your request. For example, ``https://api.checkout.com/marketplace/entities/**`ent_wxglze3wwywujg4nna5fb7ldli`**``.

#### Endpoints

Sandbox is a testing area, so you can practise API calls. [Request a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account).

 Why does the individual have a legal name? I didn't assign one.

The `legal_name` field is auto-generated based on the `first_name`, `middle_name` and `last_name` provided during onboarding.

 I didn't specify a default currency, but one was set anyway. Why?

If omitted, `profile.default_holding_currency` will be set to the default preference specified during your onboarding.

 Why can't I update my sub-entity's default holding currency?

`profile.default_holding_currency` is not currently updatable. If you need to change this, please get in touch.

 Why haven't my capabilities been enabled?

Capabilities are enabled once due diligence checks have been completed. If you haven't received a webhoook notification – either `{check}_passed` or `{check}_failed` – it is likely there are outstanding requirements due. Please check our [onboarding information page](/display/x/About+onboarding) to confirm you have sent all the required information.

If you have provided all the information, we may be completing a manual review.

The response allows you to retrieve all data that has been provided about the sub-entity, including its capabilities, which informs you whether this sub-entity can process payments or not.

Store this information, as we use it in the next step to upload identity documents.

Handle due diligence notifications
----------------------------------

Once we have conducted our due diligence checks, we will inform you of the outcome via [webhook notification](https://docs.checkout.com/four/workflows/webhook-event-types "https://docs.checkout.com/four/workflows/webhook-event-types"). You should expect to receive the following event types: 

*   `full_dd_passed` / `full_dd_failed`

Due diligence will always pass in the Sandbox environment, unless one of our `legal_name` fail triggers is used for simulation.  

On occasion, our team will need to manually review a sub-entity. Please see [about onboarding](https://docs.checkout.com/four/marketplaces/about-onboarding) for more information.

#### Due diligence webhook examples

We've described the different webhook notifications on our [webhook event type page](https://docs.checkout.com/four/workflows/webhook-event-types#Webhookeventtypes-Marketplace).

  

*   [**full\_dd\_passed**](#tabs-235aca92-d34b-4392-8402-e2abfdfbdbb7-1)
*   [**full\_dd\_failed**](#tabs-235aca92-d34b-4392-8402-e2abfdfbdbb7-2)

    {
      "id": "evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou",
      "type": "full_dd_passed",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "created_on": "2020-08-20T15:24:13.8431084Z",
      "data": {

          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/workflows/events/evt_htielsmgcwgejgqaunl4yb2pou"
        }
      }
    }
    

    {
      id: "evt_u2bs7wtytscexfrbz47qmgp62i",
      type: "full_dd_failed",
      version: "1.0.0",
      created_on: "2021-03-22T12:04:44.5996515Z",

        }
      }
    }

  
If due diligence is passed, we will enable the sub-entity’s **payments** and **payouts** capabilities. You should expect to receive the `payments_enabled` and `payout_enabled` event types.

We will re-trigger due diligence checks if any of the required information is later updated. If any subsequent checks fail and you receive the `full_dd_failed` notification, this will be followed by `payments_disabled` and `payouts_disabled` webhook notifications.
