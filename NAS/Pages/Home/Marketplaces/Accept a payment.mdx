Once your payment capabilities have been enabled, you’re ready to start processing payments on behalf of your sub-entities. On this page, we will guide you through processing payments for your sub-entities.

Our Unified Payments API enables you to process payments on behalf of a sub-entity. Follow the instructions for our [payments endpoint](https://docs.checkout.com/four/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment). The only thing that is different is that you need to include  `marketplace.sub_entity_id`. Here you should use the sub-entity ID returned during the [onboarding process](/display/x/About+onboarding).

The request
-----------

You can see an example request with this additional object below.

For more information about what these fields mean, see our [payments page](https://docs.checkout.com/four/payments/accept-payments/request-a-payment).

    {
      "amount":1000,
      "currency":"GBP",
      "reference":"ORD-5023",
      "description":"Three chocolate donuts",
      "capture":true,
      "source":{
        "type":"card",
        "number":"4242424242424242",
        "expiry_month":11,
        "expiry_year":2024,
        "cvv":"100"
      },
      "processing_channel_id":"pc_yghfzjebuiwelerjsk3atodrey",
      "marketplace":{
        "sub_entity_id":"ent_vv2jjkuf2gzj5tcw2x7ptua7zy"
      }
    }
    

  

`processing_channel_id` corresponds to a specific MCC that you are set up to process payments for. Your processing channel IDs will be provided to you after we have completed your setup.

The response
------------

Use the `approved` field to check whether the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

The following pages can help you understand the response message:

*   [CVV codes and descriptions](https://docs.checkout.com/four/resources/codes/cvv-response-codes)
*   [AVS codes](https://docs.checkout.com/four/resources/codes/avs-codes)
*   [Response codes](https://docs.checkout.com/four/resources/codes/response-codes) (if the authorization was unsuccessful)

When you make a payment, we will let you know what stage the payment is at through [webhook notifications](https://docs.checkout.com/four/workflows).

*   [**Lite**](#tabs-ed91b6df-a868-4ae0-9896-6f467c58283c-1)
*   [**Full**](#tabs-ed91b6df-a868-4ae0-9896-6f467c58283c-2)

Funds will be routed and held in your Platform’s currency accounts as per the preferences agreed for your platform during onboarding. This will include a default currency (e.g. I want all of my payments, regardless of processing currency, to be routed to and held in GBP), and possibly some like-for-like preferences (e.g. I specifically want any payments in EUR to be routed to and held in EUR).

Funds will be routed and held in your Platform’s currency accounts as per the default holding currency of your sub-entity (specified when onboarding via the Marketplace API). Please note that funds are aggregated based on currency, so if you onboard two sub-entities both with the default holding currency of GBP, funds for both of these sub-entities will be routed to your GBP currency account.
