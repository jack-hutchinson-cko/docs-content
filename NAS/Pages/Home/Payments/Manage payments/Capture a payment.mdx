This document contains a draft guide outlining how you can process various authorization types through the Unified Payments API. The information provided below is subject to change.

The Unified Payments API supports multiple partial captures—enabling you to process your capture requests at the same time as your split shipments.

Manually capture a payment
--------------------------

If a payment is requested with `capture` as `false`, you can use this endpoint to capture the payment. These captures can either be the full or partial authorization amount, but cannot be submitted for a combined amount that exceeds the total authorized balance.

### The request

Use the details below to set up your request.
