title: Void a payment

After a card payment has been authorized, the payment is not complete until it has been [captured](/display/x/Capture+a+payment). If you do not wish to capture the payment, you can void it using the void API described below.

For Visa and Mastercard payments, you can submit a void request on a partially captured payment to release the remaining funds back to the cardholder. If you don't request it, we'll automatically void the remainder and return it to the customer when the authorization expires.

### The POST request

Use the endpoint below to void an authorized—but not yet captured—payment.
