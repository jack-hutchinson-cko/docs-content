[Go to start of metadata](#page-metadata-start)

Start accepting payments using [iDEAL](https://www.checkout.com/payment-methods/accept/ideal), a favorite online payment method in The Netherlands.

iDEAL payments are made through direct online transfer from the customer's bank account to your merchant bank account. Customers can use their mobile banking app or online banking environment. As soon as a payment is made, iDEAL sends you an online payment guarantee so you can deliver goods and services right away. 

To start accepting iDEAL payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

Overview
--------

iDEAL payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request a payment](#iDEAL-requestapayment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](#iDEAL-redirectthecustomer)

REQUIRED

OBJECT

  

Details about the payment source.

`source.type`

The payment source type. Set this to `ideal`.

Up to 35 characters. Do not use special characters or HTML tags.

#### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "ideal",
        "bic":"INGBNL2A",
        "description": "ORD50234E89",
        "language": "nl"
      },
      "amount": 2000,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

### The POST response

If you receive a `202 Success` response with a payment `id` and a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_yndlioum4gau3oizxihvzdgp4i",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_erquvsbcz2xunm5rrwd5clyfiy"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_yndlioum4gau3oizxihvzdgp4i"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108659"
        }
      }
    }

  

Redirect the customer 
----------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

For security reasons, iDEAL forbids using custom-made in-app browsers for redirection. We recommend that you open the device’s default browser to display the redirect. If you do want to use an in-app web view, you must use [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) for iOS or [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) for Android.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an iDEAL payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

Get details about a payment
---------------------------

You can use the `payment_id` found in the payment response, or the `cko-session-id` from the success/failure URL (e.g., `[https://www.checkout.com/order/succeeded?cko-session-id=](https://www.checkout.com/order/succeeded?cko-session-id=)**sid_vii64oquze5u3h2x6hh4rurc4y**`) to retrieve details about the payment.

The `cko-session-id` expires 15 minutes after being created.

Testing iDEAL
-------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or integrations engineer to activate iDEAL payments in the sandbox environment.

### Test a payment request

1.  Create an iDEAL transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to the bank's website.
2.  Click **Confirm transaction**. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.

When you test a payment refund, the transaction is likely to remain in a deferred refund state. Contact us at [integration@checkout.com](mailto:integration@checkout.com) to request triggering a simulation batch job that ensures the completion of the refund.

Simulate payment states
-----------------------

In the sandbox environment, you can test different payment states by entering one of the following values in the `amount` field of your payment request.

`amount` value

Simulated status

200

Canceled

300

Expired

400

Pending

500

Failure on the iDEAL test environment

700

SO1000 Failure in system
