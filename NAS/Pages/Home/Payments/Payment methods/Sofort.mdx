[Go to start of metadata](#page-metadata-start)

Start accepting payments using [Sofort](https://www.checkout.com/payment-methods/accept/sofort), a favorite payment method in Europe.

Sofort is a direct payment method allowing your customers to use only their online banking details. Shortly after making a purchase, they receive a transaction confirmation so you can start processing the order immediately.

To start accepting Sofort payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

Overview
--------

You process a Sofort payment in two steps:

1.  [Request a payment](#Sofort-requestapayment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](#Sofort-redirectthecustomer)

#### Header parameter

Header

Value

Header

Value

`Authorization`

REQUIRED

`secret key`

Use the valid secret key of your [Checkout.com](http://checkout.com/) account. You can find this in the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2).

`Content-Type`

REQUIRED

`application/json`

#### Body parameters

The table below describes the minimum recommended fields. You can find the full list, as well as complete request and response examples, in our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post).

  

Field name

Description

Field name

Description

`source`

REQUIRED

OBJECT

Details about the payment source.

`source.type`

REQUIRED

STRING

The type of payment source. Set this to `sofort`.

`amount`

OPTIONAL

INTEGER

The payment amount.

`currency`

REQUIRED

STRING

The three-letter ISO currency code. Set this to `EUR`.

#### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "sofort"
      },
      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

### The POST response

If you receive a `202 Success` response with a payment `id` and a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_ylcikkxovyjunekfu7a444mmvy",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_izfg7cwguvxuhaquys6qtof2f4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_ylcikkxovyjunekfu7a444mmvy"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108689"
        }
      }
    }

Redirect the customer 
======================

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they will be asked to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of a Sofort payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

Get details about a payment
===========================

You can retrieve details about an existing Sofort payment with the following request.

If the payment has been approved by a customer on the banking page, you’ll receive a `payment_capture_pending` webhook and the payment response will include the `bic`, `iban`, and `account_holder_name` fields.

1.  Create a Sofort transaction as above, and then follow the redirect link to Sofort/Klarna's website.
2.  Into the **Bank name, BLZ, IBAN or BIC** field enter **88888888**, and then click **Next**.
3.  Enter **88888888** in the **Account number** field, and **123456** in the **PIN** field. Click **Next**.
4.  Select any account on the next page and then click **Next**.
5.  Enter **12345** in the **TAN** field and click **Next**.
6.  You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
    
    The payment remains in a deferred capture state. To test a full capture, contact us at [integration@checkout.com](mailto:integration@checkout.com) to request that a transaction be manually set to captured.
