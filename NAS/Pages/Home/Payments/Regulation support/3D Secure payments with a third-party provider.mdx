### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "card",
        "number": "5436031030606378",
        "expiry_month": 12,
        "expiry_year": 2025,
      },
      "amount": 257,
      "currency": "USD",
      "3ds": {
        "enabled": true,
        "eci": "06",
        "cryptogram": "123feb70-d16b-4da6-b07f-98c0",
        "xid": "79f6205c-ff5c-4a4c-8fca-90f67f3a6470",
        "version": "2.0.1"
      }
    }

The response
------------

If the `approved` field is `true`, your authorization was successful. If unsuccessful, the card used for the payment may be invalid/expired or the account has an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect.

If the card scheme provided us with an `eci` value, it will be included in the response. The value indicates the security level that the card scheme decided to authorize the payment with.
