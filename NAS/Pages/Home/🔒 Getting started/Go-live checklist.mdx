Test your integration
=====================

Our sandbox environment provides the necessary environment to make sure everything from your implementation is working perfectly. We recommend working your way through the steps listed below.

When you've completed a step, you can click the checkbox to mark it as done. Note that this will get cleared if you refresh the page.

  

function toggleImage() { var img1 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-blank.svg"; var img2 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-green.svg"; var imgElement = document.getElementById('toggleImage'); imgElement.src = (imgElement.src === img1)? img2 : img1; }

![](https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-blank.svg)

Test your card payments. Remember to use our test cards because genuine card numbers will produce an error in your sandbox environment.

function toggleImage2() { var img3 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-red.svg"; var img4 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-green.svg"; var imgElement = document.getElementById('toggleImage2'); imgElement.src = (imgElement.src === img3)? img4 : img3; }

Test the payment response codes using the trigger amounts.

![](https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-blank.svg)

Test a 3DS payment. You'll receive a redirect URL to a 3DS authentication simulator page.

![](https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-blank.svg)

Whitelist the Checkout IP addresses listed here. You'll need to do this to successfully receive webhook notifications.

![](https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-blank.svg)

Test your webhooks and make sure you're getting all the event notifications you'd expect. For example, `Payment approve`, `Payment Refunded`, `Dispute Evidence Required`.
