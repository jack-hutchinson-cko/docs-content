Test your integration
=====================

Our sandbox environment provides the necessary environment to make sure everything from your implementation is working perfectly. We recommend working your way through the steps listed below.

When you've completed a step, you can click the checkbox to mark it as done. Note that this will get cleared if you refresh the page.

  

function toggleImage() { var img1 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-blank.svg"; var img2 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-green.svg"; var imgElement = document.getElementById('toggleImage'); imgElement.src = (imgElement.src === img1)? img2 : img1; }

Test your card payments. Remember to use our test cards because genuine card numbers will produce an error in your sandbox environment.

function toggleImage2() { var img3 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-red.svg"; var img4 = "https://assets.checkout.com/docs/images/checkmark-green.svg"; var imgElement = document.getElementById('toggleImage2'); imgElement.src = (imgElement.src === img3)? img4 : img3; }

Test the payment response codes using the trigger amounts.

Test a 3DS payment. You'll receive a redirect URL to a 3DS authentication simulator page.

Whitelist the Checkout IP addresses listed here. You'll need to do this to successfully receive webhook notifications.

Test your webhooks and make sure you're getting all the event notifications you'd expect. For example, `Payment approve`, `Payment Refunded`, `Dispute Evidence Required`.
