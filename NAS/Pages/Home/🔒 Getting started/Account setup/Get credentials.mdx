To integrate with Checkout, you'll first need to get a test account (also called sandbox account) set up by our team. Each account has its own access key secret ID, access key secret, processing channel(s) and public API key. This pages outlines the steps you need to follow to retrieve these credentials.

The content of this guide only applies to users who have already started the onboarding process. If you haven't spoken to our team yet, please [get in touch](mailto:support@checkout.com).

**Step 1:** Create a public and private RSA key pair 
=====================================================

In order for us to securely send your credentials to you, you'll need to provide us with a public RSA key with a bit length of at least 2048. 

We recommend creating a dedicated key pair only for this purpose using openssl in the command line.

Create a private key
--------------------

Run the following command to generate a private key:

    openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:password123 -out private-key.pem 2048

  

You need to keep the private key file and the password private at all times. These can be later used to decrypt the secret you receive from us.

Create a public key
-------------------

Run the following command to export your public key file:

    openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -outform PEM -passin pass:password123 -pubout -out public-key.pem

Send us your public key
-----------------------

Send us your public key file. We'll then use it to encrypt your access key secret before sending it to you.

**Step 2:** Receive your credentials
====================================

Once we have your public key, we'll send you a set of credentials which includes the following:

*   an access key ID (`client_id`)
*   an encrypted access key secret (`client_secret`)
*   either one or several processing channel IDs (`processing_channel_id`), depending on your setup
*   a public API key

Almost all endpoints require you to use OAuth access keys rather than API keys. The only exception is the `/tokens` endpoint, which should only be used for testing purposes. View the API reference for it [here](https://api-reference.checkout.com/preview/crusoe/#tag/Tokens).

What about the Dashboard?

Our Support team will create an account for you, using your email address as the username. You'll then receive an email containing a link to click on so that you can set your own password.

**Step 3:** Decrypt the access key secret
=========================================

You'll receive the encrypted secret associated with your access key in a file called `ack_clckqmmnyfiupexjew7shh5ahe.enc`. You can decrypt it in the command line using the following command:

    cat ack_clckqmmnyfiupexjew7shh5ahe.enc | openssl base64 -d -A | openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private-key.pem -passin pass:password123

The output of this command will give you the `client_secret` needed for token creation in cleartext.

For additional security, you can also store the encrypted secret in your integration’s configuration store (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault), and decrypt it during token creation.

What's next?
============

You're now ready to [get an access token](/display/x/Get+an+access+token) which you'll then use in your requests.
