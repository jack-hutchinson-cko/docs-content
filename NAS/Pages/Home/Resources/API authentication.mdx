Server-to-server
----------------

For server-to-server communication, we support two different mechanisms for authentication:

*   [OAuth 2.0 client credentials](/display/x/OAuth+2.0+client+credentials)
*   [API keys](/display/x/API+keys)

Our Customer Success team can help you decide which of the two options is best suited to your requirements.

Client-side
-----------

For client-side communication, we support [public API keys](https://docs.checkout.com/four/resources/api-authentication/api-keys#APIkeys-Publickeys).
