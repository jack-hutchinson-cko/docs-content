title: OAuth 2.0 client credentials
account: NAS
---

When you're onboarded with us, you'll receive access credentials which you'll use to generate access tokens to authenticate calls to our APIs. These credentials consist of two parts:

- The **access key ID** (corresponding to the OAuth 2.0 client ID).
- The **access key secret** (corresponding to the OAuth 2.0 client secret).

You can either have a **single set of credentials**, which has access to all the APIs you want to use, or **multiple sets of credentials**, each of which has access to a specific set of APIs you will use.

Multiple credential sets use case

For example, let's say you have separate systems for processing payments and managing webhooks. Each one has different security requirements, and you don't want the webhook management system to have access to any sensitive information about payment processing. To keep them separate, you could have one set of credentials to access our Unified Payment API for payment processing, and a second set that only has access to our Workflows API for webhook management.

## OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

OAuth 2.0 authentication is designed for server-to-server authentication. It works as follows:
. Make a request to our /tokens endpoint, exchanging your access key ID and secret for an access token. As part of this request, you can also include one or more scopes, which define which endpoints the token can access. 2. If your request is successful, the response will contain an access token. 3. Use the newly created access token to authenticate requests to our APIs.

The access tokens are designed to be short-lived, increasing their security. You'll find the expiry time in the create token response.

## Multiple processing channels

A processing channel contains a set of configurations used when processing a payment. If you have complex processing requirements, we may have set up multiple processing channels for you during onboarding.

For example, if you accept payments across multiple merchant category codes, you might use a different processing channel for each one.

When requesting payments through the Unified Payments API, you will have two options for how to route your payments between each processing channel:

- A **single set of credentials** for all processing channels, which requires you to specify the processing channel in your payment request.
- **Multiple sets of credentials** – one for each processing channel – so you don't need to specify the processing channel in your payment request.

If you need help with your access setup, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

## Setting up your access credentials

When we send you your access credentials, they will be in an encrypted form. To access them you need to provide us with a public RSA key. And to use it in authenticating your calls to our API, you need to decrypt it using a secret RSA key.

Create a public and private RSA key pair by following the steps below.

### Step 1: Create an RSA key pair

Enter the following command into your command line. This will create a 2048-bit RSA key pair – a public RSA key and a secret RSA key.

    openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:password123 -out private-key.pem 2048

To export the public RSA key file you've just generated, enter the following command.

    openssl rsa -in private-key.pem -outform PEM -passin pass:password123 -pubout -out public-key.pem

Keep your private RSA key file and the password private at all times. You'll use these to unencrypt the access key secret you received from us. You only ever need to share your public RSA key file with us.

### Step 2: Decrypt the secret

You can now use your RSA key pair to decrypt your access key secret.

You will have received your access key secret from us in an encrypted file called `ack_clckqmmnyfiupexjew7shh5ahe.enc`. To decrypt it, enter the following command in your command line:

    cat ack_clckqmmnyfiupexjew7shh5ahe.enc | openssl base64 -d -A | openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey private-key.pem -passin pass:password123

In the response, you'll receive your access key secret in cleartext.

For additional security, you can store the encrypted secret in your integration's configuration store (for example, AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault), and decrypt when you authenticate a call to our APIs.

## Using OAuth 2.0 authentication

### Step 1: Generate an access token

Use your access credentials (access key ID and access key secret) to generate an access token with which you can authenticate calls to our APIs.

  --data-urlencode 'scope=gateway'

#### The POST response

Below is an example of a successful response. The token server will return a Bearer `access_token` in JSON Web Token (JWT) format.

Your access token is valid for the length of time (in seconds) indicated by the `expires_in` field. When it expires, you'll need to request a new one.

    {
      "access_token": "eyJhb6sqaQ",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "scope":"flow fx gateway"
    }

### Step 2: Authenticate API request with access token

You can then provide your access token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests, with the `Bearer` prefix. For example:

    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.checkout.com/payments'
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'Accept: application/json' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{AccessToken}}' \
      --data-raw '{
        "amount": 10000,
        "currency": "USD",
        "reference": "Visa-USD-Test",
        ...
      }'

## Managing your access keys in the Dashboard

You can view your access keys and generate new access key secrets from the Dashboard.

### Viewing your access keys

You must be an Owner, Admin, or Developer of your Dashboard account to view your access keys.

To view your access keys, log in to the Dashboard and go to **Settings** > **Access Keys**. From here you can see all of your access keys  and the scope for each one of them.

### Managing your access keys

You must be an Owner of your Dashboard account, and have `keys:manage` permission, to manage your access keys.

To manage your access keys, log in to the Dashboard, go to **Settings** > **Access Keys**, then click on one of the keys to view its details.

![](/download/attachments/20121049/access%20key%20modal.png?version=1&modificationDate=1619538065996&api=v2)

If you want to generate a new secret for the access key, click **Generate secret**, then click **Generate**.

![](/download/attachments/20121049/generate%20secret.png?version=1&modificationDate=1619538233913&api=v2)

When you generate a new secret, the old access key secret is disabled, so make sure you use the new secret in all future requests.
