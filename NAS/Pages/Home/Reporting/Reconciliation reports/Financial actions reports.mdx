Financial actions reports provide an accurate representation of all actions during a payment’s life-cycle that impact your currency account's available balance[.](http://checkout.com/ "http://Checkout.com") Together with the payouts reports, you can reconcile payments and any associated fees against payouts paid out to you.  
  
Understanding the financial impact of each action and any foreign exchange (FX) rates applied also allows you to accurately assess your cost of sale.

Understanding your financial actions reports
--------------------------------------------

The reports come in two forms:

*   **Financial actions by date range**: contains financial actions across a specified time period.

*   **Financial actions by payout ID**: contains financial actions related to a specific payout ID—useful when reconciling financial actions with a payout paid out to your bank account.

Every row features a unique financial action ID that can be linked to a specific payment, using the payment ID, or a settled payout, using the payout ID.

Both reports feature identical field names and list records chronologically.

Report format
-------------

Financial actions reports come in .csv format with the file name following these templates:

*   **Financial actions by date range**:   
    `financialactions_{Your Entity-ID}_{Start Date Range:YYYYMMDD}___{End Date Range:YYYYMMDD}_1.csv`

*   **Financial actions by payout ID**: `financialactions_{Your Entity-ID}_{Payout date: YYYYMMDD}_{PayoutID}_1.csv`

When are my reports available?
