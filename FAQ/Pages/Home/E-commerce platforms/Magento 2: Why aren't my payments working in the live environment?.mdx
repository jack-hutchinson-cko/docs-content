title: Magento 2: Why aren't my payments working in the live environment?
account: FAQ 
---
To ensure your payments work in the live environment, follow the checklist below when moving from sandbox to live:

*   Update the environment to live/production.
*   Update your secret key in the plugin settings.
*   Update your public key in the plugin settings.
*   Update your private shared key in the plugin settings. (Youâ€™ll need to configure the webhook URL in the live environment to get this.)
*   Configure your webhooks for the live environment.
*   If you use wallets, like Apple Pay and Google Pay, make sure you update the IDs and certificates with the live/production details.
