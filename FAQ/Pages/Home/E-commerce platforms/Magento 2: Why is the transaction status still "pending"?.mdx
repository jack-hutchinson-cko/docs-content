title: Magento 2: Why is the transaction status still "pending"?
account: FAQ 
---


If a transaction is stuck with a "pending" status after the transaction is completed, first check that your API keys (private, public and private shared keys) are correct, and that your webhooks are configured correctly. If they are, check that you have selected the correct API version (v2.0) for your webhooks, and that (if you have it set) auto capture / capture delay is set to at least 0.02.
