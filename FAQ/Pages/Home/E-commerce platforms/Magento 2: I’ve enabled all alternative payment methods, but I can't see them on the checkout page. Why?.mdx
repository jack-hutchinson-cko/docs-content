title: Magento 2: I’ve enabled all alternative payment methods, but I can't see them on the checkout page. Why?

If you want to use alternative payment methods, we first need to enable them on your account. Please email our Support team at [support@checkout.com](mailto:support@checkout.com) for this. In addition, some local payment methods only work in certain currencies, so they won't be displayed if you use a different currency in your store. For example, for Sofort, you need to use EUR to see it as a payment option on your checkout page.
