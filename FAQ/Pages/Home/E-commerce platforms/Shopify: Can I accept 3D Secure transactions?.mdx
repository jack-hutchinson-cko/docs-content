title: Shopify: Can I accept 3D Secure transactions?
account: FAQ 
---
If you use our onsite Shopify integration and want to use 3D Secure (3DS) authentication, Shopify requires you to use Cardinal Commerce as a third-party 3DS provider.  
  
If you use the offsite Shopify integration, we can activate 3DS for you for all your transactions, or you can enable risk rules that only trigger 3DS for certain cases. Please email our Support team atÂ [support@checkout.com](mailto:support@checkout.com) for help.
