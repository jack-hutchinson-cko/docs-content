For plugin versions 4.X or later, you need to set the following URLs in your [Hub](https://sandbox.checkout.com/) account (replacing `example.com` with your siteâ€™s URL):

*   Redirection (success/failure): example.com/?wc-api=wc\_checkoutcom\_callback
*   Webhook: example.com/?wc-api=wc\_checkoutcom\_webhook
*   See [GitHub](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-woocommerce-plugin/wiki/URLs--2.x) for the URLs required for older plugin versions
