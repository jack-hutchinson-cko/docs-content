You need plugin version 4.1.12 or later for this functionality, so make sure you have the latest version of our plugin. This can be downloaded from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/checkout-com-unified-payments-api/#developers) or as a .zip file fromÂ [GitHub](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-woocommerce-plugin).

Also, make sure that you've [deactivated/deleted any previous versions of the plugin](https://docs.checkout.com/quickstart/integrate/e-commerce-platforms/woocommerce#WooCommerce-Checkyouhavenopreviousversionoftheplugin) you may have installed.
