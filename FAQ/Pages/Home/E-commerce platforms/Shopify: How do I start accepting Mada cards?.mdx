title: Shopify: How do I start accepting Mada cards?
account: FAQ

Mada cards are only supported on our offsite Shopify integration. If you want to accept Mada cards, you will need to contact our Support team at [support@checkout.com](mailto:support@checkout.com)Â so we can enforce 3D Secure authentication, which is required for all Mada card payments. You will also need a Mada-capable payment processor to process Mada cards locally.
