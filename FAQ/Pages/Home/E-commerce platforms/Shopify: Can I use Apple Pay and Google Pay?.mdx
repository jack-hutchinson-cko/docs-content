title: Shopify: Can I use Apple Pay and Google Pay?
account: FAQ 
---
Shopify limits third-party payment providers from offering features like Apple Pay and Google Pay, so you can't use them with our plugin. However, if you are using Shopify Plus, you can build the integration with us and add Apple Pay and Google Pay. You will need a Shopify developer to set this up.
