title: I've created a test account. How do I start integrating to my website, and go live?

First, you'll want to select your preferred [integration method](/display/DOCS/Integrate), decide on the [payment methods](/display/DOCS/Payment+methods) you want to support, and pick any other APIs or capabilities you think you'll find useful.

By default, you can test all your card payment flows. However, if you require any alternative payment methods (e.g., PayPal, Sofort, iDEAL) you can contact our Integration team at [integration@checkout.com](mailto:integration@checkout.com) to enable them on your test account.

Once you've [run some initial tests](/display/DOCS/Testing) to make sure everything's running smoothly, you can then apply for a live account to start processing payments with us. Please contact our Sales team at [sales@checkout.com](mailto:sales@checkout.com). We'll need you to complete an online application form, which will then be reviewed by our in-house Onboarding team.

We may ask you to provide further documentation, including corporate structure documentation, legal entity details, bank account information, and principal owners.

Once approved, you’ll execute a contract and we'll provide you with your production credentials.

We then recommend that you perform a test transaction, or run a pilot in production, before processing real customer transactions. This gives you the opportunity to ensure that everything is set up correctly and will work as expected.

After that, you're ready to start accepting live payments from your customers!
