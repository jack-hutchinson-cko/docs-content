title: How do I integrate Apple Pay into my account?
account: FAQ 
---

Before you can start accepting Apple Pay payments, you'll need a few things:

*   An Apple Developer account
*   A valid SSL certificate on your website (not required for mobile apps)
*   A [sandbox Apple Pay Wallet](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/sandbox-testing/) and a compatible device (an iPhone, iPad or Mac), for testing.

Once you've sorted the above, you can:

*   [Link Checkout.com to your Apple Developer account](/payment-methods/wallets/apple-pay). (The certificates, .pem/.key are only needed for web integrations.)
*   Follow [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/implementation/) to integrate the Apple Pay button, and then follow [our documentation](/payment-methods/wallets/apple-pay) to learn how to process payments after you complete the Apple Pay flow.

Read our [Apple Pay guide](/display/DOCS/Apple+Pay)Â for more information on Apple Pay integration and payments.
