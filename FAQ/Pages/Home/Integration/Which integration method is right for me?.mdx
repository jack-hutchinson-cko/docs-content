****Payment Links**** are our simplest method for accepting payments, through any device or channel. Send a payment link to your customer via their preferred channel (email, live chat, text message...) and they'll be taken to a Checkout.com-hosted payment page to complete their purchase.

****Hosted Payments Pages**** allow you to accept payments through a Checkout.com-hosted page. The customer enters their payment details on the page, and in the background we generate a token and complete the payment request.

**Frames** is a highly customizable payment form which allows your customers to enter their sensitive card information in a safe environment right on your own checkout page. This information will be exchanged with a secure token that you can use to perform payments. By using Frames your platform will never touch the card details.

**SDKs** (software development kits) give you the freedom to build your own custom payment form on your website or mobile app, or use our own pre-built form. We'll take care of the processing side of things, and return the tokenized payment information to you.

**E-commerce platforms** are great if you want to get up and running quickly. Use one of our plugins to start accepting payments through your favourite e-commerce platform.

**Full card details API** may be the option for you if you're looking for total control over the checkout experience. Unlike our other integration methods, the full card details API does not use card tokens. Instead, you process your customers' card details directly. As a result, you must have the correct level of PCI DSS compliance (Self-Assessment Questionnaire D – SAQ D) to use this method.

You can [learn more about each integration method](/display/DOCS/Integrate) on our documentation site.
