If your website is built on Shopify or Salesforce Cloud Commerce, or you use Spreedly, please contact our [Support team](mailto:support@checkout.com).

If you are building a custom integration on your website and collecting the card information in your own payment form to send payment requests to Checkout.com, you will notice this error.

Making requests with raw card details is risky, and we reject it by default. You can still send payment requests with full card details, but this requires you to have the correct level of PCI DSS compliance (Self-Assessment Questionnaire D – SAQ D). If you have this level of certification, please tell your customer success manager and we'll enable this flow for you.

If you don't have the right level of PCI compliance for your platform, you can use [Frames](/display/DOCS/Frames), [Hosted Payment Pages](/display/DOCS/Hosted+Payments+Page), or another of our [integration methods](/display/DOCS/Integrate) to collect the sensitive card data, and then [perform payments](/display/DOCS/Request+a+card+payment) with the secure token these integrations generate.
