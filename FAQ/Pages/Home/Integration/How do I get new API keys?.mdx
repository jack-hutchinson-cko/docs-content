In your Hub account, head to **Settings** > **Channels** and click **Regenerate** next to the key (either secret or public) you want to update. Enter your password when prompted to confirm the update.

Please note that when you update your secret key, all API requests using the old key will be denied. To continue using the API successfully, update your code with the new key.
