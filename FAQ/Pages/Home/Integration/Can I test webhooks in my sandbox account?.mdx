Yes. To add a webhook in the Hub, go to **Settings** > **Channels** and clickÂ **New webhook**.

Once added, you can choose what event you want to receive webhooks for. To trigger the webhooks, just perform a transaction and take one of the actions you enabled. For example, if you chose the `payment\_refunded` event, just perform a refund and you will get a webhook.

Find out more about the [events for which you can create webhooks](/display/DOCS/Event+types).
