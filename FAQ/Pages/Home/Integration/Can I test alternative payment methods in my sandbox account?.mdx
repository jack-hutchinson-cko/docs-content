Yes, you can test most of the alternative payment methods (APMs) we support in the sandbox environment.

To start testing, please contact your customer success manager or integration engineer to activate the APMs you want to test in your sandbox account.

Follow the links on our [APM testing page](/display/DOCS/APM+testing)Â to find out how to test each payment method.
