title: What is the 3D Secure liability shift, and when does it apply?
account: FAQ 
---

This is when the liability for fraud-related chargebacks (e.g., your customer denies they made a purchase, suspecting someone has stolen their card details) shifts from you to the card issuer – generally the customer’s bank.

The shift occurs when an online card payment is authenticated with 3D Secure (3DS). See our [Strong Customer Authentication compliance guide](/display/DOCS/SCA+compliance+guide) for more information.
