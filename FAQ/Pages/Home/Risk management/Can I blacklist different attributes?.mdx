account: FAQ

Yes. You can blacklist the following attributes:

*   card
*   IP address
*   email address
*   phone number

We manage a global blacklist of cards that have been blacklisted by other [Checkout.com](http://Checkout.com) merchants, and we block any card that has been blacklisted by at least three other merchants.

If you want to change your risk settings, please get in touch with our Risk team at [risk@checkout.com](mailto:risk@checkout.com).
