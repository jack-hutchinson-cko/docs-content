title: Do I need to submit evidence if I've already refunded the customer?
account: FAQ

No. If you’ve already fully refunded the customer, we will automatically defend against the dispute by sending the issuer the refund information. You will not be debited the disputed amount, but you will be charged a dispute fee.

If you've partially refunded the customer, you still need to respond to the part of the dispute that covers the unrefunded amount. Once you've accepted or challenged that part of the dispute, we will send the evidence of your partial refund to the issuer.
