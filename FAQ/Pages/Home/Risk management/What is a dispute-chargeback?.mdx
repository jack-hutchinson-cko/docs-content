title: What is a dispute/chargeback?
account: FAQ 
---

Disputes (also known as chargebacks) arise when a customer queries a transaction with their card issuer – usually because the customer suspects fraud. The issuer then creates a formal dispute which immediately reverses the payment, and debits your account for both the payment amount and a dispute fee (e.g., £15 for merchants in the United Kingdom).

You will then have the opportunity to challenge the dispute and to provide the issuer with evidence of the legitimacy of the transaction.

See our [disputes guide](/display/DOCS/Disputes) for more information.
