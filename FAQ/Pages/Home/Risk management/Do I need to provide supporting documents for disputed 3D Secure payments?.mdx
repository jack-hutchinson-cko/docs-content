title: Do I need to provide supporting documents for disputed 3D Secure payments?
account: FAQ

You're not required to provide us with any supporting documents to re-present/deal with pre-arbitration for a fraud dispute, **unless** the payment was 3D Secure-authenticated by a third party.

If the payment was 3DS-authenticated by us, our Disputes team will proceed with re-presentment/dealing with pre-arbitration, using our internal authentication log as reference.

If the payment was 3DS-authenticated by a third party, which we do not recommend, you will need to provide us with the authentication log.
