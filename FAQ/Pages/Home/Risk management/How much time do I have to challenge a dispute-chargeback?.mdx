title: How much time do I have to challenge a dispute/chargeback?
account: FAQ

The expiry date for each dispute/chargeback is specified in your Hub account.

We recommend you pay particular attention to Amex disputes, because they have a tighter time frame for re-presentment than other card schemes.
