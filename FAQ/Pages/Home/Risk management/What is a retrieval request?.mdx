title: What is a retrieval request?

A retrieval request (also known as a request for information or soft chargeback) is a request from the customer's bank (the issuer) asking for more information about a transaction.

The issuer may do this before raising a formal dispute, or use it instead of a dispute if they can no longer raise one because too much time has passed since the transaction. No money is taken from your account at this stage.

You should provide the requested information to the issuer as quickly as possible. And, if you think the transaction being questioned is not valid, it's best to refund the customer to avoid the potential of a formal dispute being raised.

If you act promptly, you may prevent a chargeback.
