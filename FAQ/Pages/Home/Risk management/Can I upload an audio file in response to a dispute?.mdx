title: Can I upload an audio file in response to a dispute?

No. Card schemes require you to submit evidence as either a JPEG or PDF file. If you have an audio recording that supports your claim, we recommend transcribing its contents in order to submit that as evidence.

In addition, you cannot submit video files, links to third-party websites (a screenshot may be submitted if relevant) or file downloads, or ask that the card issuer contacts you for more information. The issuer will not accept these as evidence.
