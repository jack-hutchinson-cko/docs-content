Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), introduced by the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), is an upgraded security measure that is used to authenticate online card payments. It came into effect on 31 December 2020 in the European Economic Area (EEA), and will come into effect on 14 September 2021 in the UK.

3D Secure 2 (3DS2) is the new version of the 3D Secure authentication protocol. It is the best way to implement SCA, adding multi-factor authentication and data-rich risk analysis to online card payments.
