Statements are an easy way to view the processed amount, refunds, chargebacks, processing fees, rolling reserve moments, and general adjustments for a given period in your account.

They are generated automatically based on your payout frequencies, and you can find them in the _Statements_ screen in the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com).

Read our [statements guide](/display/DOCS/Statements+explained) for more information.
