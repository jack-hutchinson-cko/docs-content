It means that the webhook associated with a specific event type is not being received properly.

We will keep trying to send to that endpoint for 7 days, after which you will be unsubscribed from that event type. To remain subscribed, update your webhook settings in the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com) under **Settings > Channels**. You will continue to receive webhook notifications for other events that are being processed successfully.

Note that failed webhooks will never impact the processing of payments in any way. They are only notifications designed to help you stay informed of what's happening with your business in real time.

Learn more about [webhooks](/display/DOCS/Webhooks), and the [webhook retry mechanism](https://docs.checkout.com/reporting-and-insights/webhooks#Webhooks-webhookretries).
