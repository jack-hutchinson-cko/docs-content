Each payment is uniquely identified with an ID which is created at the first action administered to a payment â€“ usually the authorization.

If you include this ID in your request, you'll get all the actions associated with the payment and all the related fees and amounts.

In the CSV report, you'll see that each row corresponds to a payment fee or an amount relating to a certain action.
