title: How should I use the Reconciliation API if I want to reconcile it against one of my statements?
account: FAQ

You should get the statement ID of your statement and add it in the `/statements` endpoint.

Do not use the statement period date because if for some reason an action has only been taken into account in a later date, then it will appear in a later statement even if it will still show the original date when the action was taken.
