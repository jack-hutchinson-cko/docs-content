title: What is the difference between the payments report endpoint and the statement reports?
account: FAQ 
---
The payments report endpoint only contains transactional information.

Non-transactional information is only included in the statements endpoint. This includesÂ business- or merchant-level data, such as the payout fee, payout fee tax, admin fees or general adjustments.

The payments report endpoint is a view of your processed volume and fees at payment level, but it won't allow you to reconcile the amounts against your payout amounts. This is because payouts contain non-transactional elements which are not reflected in this report.
