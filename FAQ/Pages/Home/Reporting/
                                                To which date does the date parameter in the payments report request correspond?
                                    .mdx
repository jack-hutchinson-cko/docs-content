[Go to start of metadata](#page-metadata-start)

When you create your request, you can specify a date. This date corresponds to the original date of the first action administered to a payment – usually the authorization. In the payments report endpoint’s response, you will get all the subsequent actions and amounts that are related to this payment, even if they occurred on a later date.

For example, when you set a date range from `2019-01-21` to `2019-01-21`, you will get all actions related to the payments where the first date of the first action of the payment was `2019-01-21`, which will most likely be the date of the authorization. Even if the interchange fees are only applied on `2019-01-22` (i.e., one day later), you would still see them in your report for the `2019-01-21` as long as your request happens after they have been taken into account (i.e., after `2019-01-22`).
