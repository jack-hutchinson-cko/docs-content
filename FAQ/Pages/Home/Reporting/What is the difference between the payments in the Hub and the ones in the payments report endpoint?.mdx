title: What is the difference between the payments in the Hub and the ones in the payments report endpoint?

In the payments report endpoint, you'll only find payments that are associated with movement of funds or fee application.

For example, you won't find any mention of a declined payment that would have no associated fees. But that payment would be visible on the Hub, because it is a reflection of any payments processed through Checkout.com.
