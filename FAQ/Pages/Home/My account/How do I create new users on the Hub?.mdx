If you are the administrator of your Hub account, you can add new users from the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/login). Go to _Settings > User management_ and click **New user**.

Once created, their profile will be added to the user list and they will receive an email inviting them to log in.

Take a look at our [Hub settings guide](/display/DOCS/Update+your+Hub+settings) for more information.
