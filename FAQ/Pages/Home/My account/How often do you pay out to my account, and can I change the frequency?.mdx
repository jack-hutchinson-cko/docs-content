account: FAQ 
---
You can find the payout frequency in the **Payouts** section of the _Settings_ in your Hub account. Alternatively, you can find it in the Pricing Schedule of your Merchant Services Agreement.

If you want to get paid quicker, or otherwise change the frequency at which we pay out to your account, please contact your customer success manager.
