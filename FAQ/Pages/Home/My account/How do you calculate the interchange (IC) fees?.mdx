title: How do you calculate the interchange (IC) fees?
account: FAQ 
---
We pay interchange fees to your issuing bank to cover the handling costs and inherent risks (such as bad credit and fraud) involved in approving payments.

These fees are influenced by various factors, including:

*   **Transaction type** (domestic vs international; point-of-sale vs online)
*   **Type of card** (credit, debit or pre-paid; commercial or consumer)
*   **Industry** (merchants operating in higher-risk industries generally pay higher fees)

If you want to see the current interchange rate tables, contact your customer success manager and they can share them with you.
