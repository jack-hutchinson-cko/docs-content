title: What does the response code of my transaction mean?
account: FAQ 
---

The `response_code` is a five-digit numeric code that indicates the status of the payment request. Additional information may be found in the `response_summary` and `status` fields of the response.

The statuses fall within one of four categories:

*   APPROVED (10000 codes). The request was successful.
*   SOFT DECLINE (20000 codes). The request was declined, though subsequent attempts may be successful.
*   HARD DECLINE (30000 codes). The request was declined. Most hard declines require the issuer or cardholder to fix the outstanding issue(s) before trying again.
*   RISK RESPONSE (40000 codes). The request triggered a risk response. The status of the response (response\_code and status) will depend on the action specified in your risk settings.

Please refer to our [response code guide](/display/DOCS/Response+codes)Â to learn about specific codes.
