title: Why are Apple Pay and Google Pay card numbers different on the Hub?
account: FAQ 
---

Apple Pay and Google Pay enforce using virtual card numbers, so that your physical card details are never exposed. The last few digits will therefore always appear to be different on the Hub, as these correspond to the virtual card's last digits and not the physical one's.

If you need to find a specific Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction on the Hub, we recommend performing a search using other details such as the payment ID or reference.
