You cannot cancel or void a refund. However, you can charge the customer a new payment on the same card.

You can do this by:

*   using the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com). To do so, simply open the customer details page and click the **Create payment** button.
*   using the [Unified Payments API](https://docs.checkout.com/docs/request-a-card-payment)

Be sure to tell the customer beforehand.
