You can find the Acquirer Reference Number (ARN) for a payment in the _Payments_ section of theÂ [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com). Just click on the relevant payment action to open up the summary, and you'll find the ARN under the **Action details** heading.

Alternatively, you can find the ARN in the response of the [get payment actions endpoint](/display/DOCS/Get+payment+actions), as well as in the `payment_captured` and `payment_refunded` webhook notifications.
