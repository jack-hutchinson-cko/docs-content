If you receive an error code, it means something has gone wrong with your request. The code will tell you the nature of the problem, with the usual issues being invalid formatting (like an invalid shipping address) and processing errors (like a payment method not being supported). Please refer to our [error codes guide](/display/DOCS/Error+codes)Â to learn about specific codes.
