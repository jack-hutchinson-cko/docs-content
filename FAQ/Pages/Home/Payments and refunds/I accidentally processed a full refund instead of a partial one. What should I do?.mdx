You cannot cancel a refund. However, you can charge the customer a new transaction.

To do so, go to the _Customers_ section of your [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com) account, select the customer you want to charge and click **Create payment**.

You should tell the customer before doing this, to avoid confusion.
