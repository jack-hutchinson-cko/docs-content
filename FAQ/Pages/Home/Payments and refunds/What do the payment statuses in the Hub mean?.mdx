Payment statuses (also called payment actions) refer to the various statuses that a given payment goes through. For example, a card payment might go from being authorized (`AUTH`) to captured (`CAPTURE`) before finally being refunded (`REFUND`). Each of these statuses will be displayed in the **Action** column of the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com)'s _Payments_ screen, as well as in the payment details.

To view a list of all possible statuses and what they mean, take a look at our [payment actions guide](/display/DOCS/About+payment+actions).
