title: Can I perform refunds through the Unified Payments API on payments created using the Classic API?

Yes. To do so, call the [`/refunds` endpoint](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment) in the Unified Payments API with the charge ID of your captured payment.

If you rely on webhooks, you will need to maintain your Classic API webhook handler to perform refunds like this, because we will send you Classic API event types for this particular scenario.
