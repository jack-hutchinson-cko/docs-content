title: Sender data for Card Payouts
account: ABC
---


If you're sending a card payout on behalf of another person (a money transfer), or a business/government entity (a third-party funds disbursement), you must include the details of that person or entity in the `processing.senderInformation` object in your payout request. You can see example payout requests with sender data on our [Card Payouts page](/display/DRAFT/Card+Payouts).

The data you need to provide depends on the card scheme:

*   [Visa](#SenderdataforCardPayouts-visa)
*   [Mastercard](#SenderdataforCardPayouts-mastercard)

If you don't provide sender data when it's required, your transaction will be declined.

For more details about sender data requirements, please contact your implementation manager.
