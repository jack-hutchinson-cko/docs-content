With this additional field, you can send multiple types of payments to Checkout.com through a single merchant setup. For example, Account-to-Account and Person-to-Person.

Overview
--------

Schemes require each payment to be accompanied by a Fund Transfer Type code, which indicates the type of payment a merchant is making. This is because differently levels of screening are applied to different types of payments.

For merchants who only send one type of payment, we can configure this in our settings. However, for merchants who are sending different types of payments (e.g,. a remittance company sending both Account-to-Account and Person-to-Person payments), we enable merchants to send a Fund Transfer Type code with each transaction, identifying the type of transaction.

The benefits of this are having a single entity set up within Checkout.com, with flexible payment type settings.

Dynamic Fund Transfer Type in the payment request
-------------------------------------------------

In order to specify the Fund Transfer Type in your Unified Payments API payment request, you can include an optional string field in the payment request called `fund_transfer_type`.
