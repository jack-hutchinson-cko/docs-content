Our disputes API helps you find out about and act on all of your open disputes within the required timeframe. Together with our webhooks, which help you keep track of each status change of a dispute, you'll be well equipped to handle any disputes that arise.

With our disputes API, you can:

*   [View a list of disputes](#DisputesAPI-getlistofdisputes)
*   [View information about a specific dispute](#DisputesAPI-getdetailsaboutdispute)
*   [Provide evidence](#DisputesAPI-provideevidence)
*   [Accept a dispute](#DisputesAPI-acceptdispute)

If you want to simulate a dispute for testing purposes, you can do so in the sandbox environment. Simply create a payment with one of the test cards and specify the amount [as documented here](/display/DOCS/Disputes+testing).

Dispute reasons
---------------

Most of the time, customers dispute a payment because of fraudulent charges. However, there are many other possible reasons. You can tell why a dispute was raised by looking at the `category` field of the response.

Learn more about the [reasons for disputes and the type of evidence we suggest submitting](https://docs.checkout.com/risk-management/disputes#Disputes-Disputereasonsandrecommendedevidence) when responding.

Dispute statuses
----------------

Each dispute has an associated `status` that describes which stage of the dispute process it has reached.

If you would like to be notified when the status of a dispute changes, you can use our [webhooks](/display/DOCS/Webhooks).

Status

Description

Webhook event type

`evidence_required`

An action on your side is required (you need to respond to the dispute). At this stage, your account gets debited the disputed amount.

`dispute_evidence_required`

View a [dispute evidence required webhook example](/display/DOCS/dispute_evidence_required).

`resolved`

We automatically resolve the dispute because it had already been refunded previously. There are no further financial implications.

`dispute_resolved`

View a [dispute resolved webhook example](/display/DOCS/dispute_resolved).  

`canceled`

The dispute is canceled by the issuing bank and your account is credited back of the amount of the dispute. You don’t need to take any further action.

`dispute_canceled`

View a [dispute canceled webhook example](/display/DOCS/dispute_canceled).

`evidence_under_review`

You have submitted evidence to defend against the dispute. Your evidence is now under review by our Disputes team. Once reviewed, the team will send it to the card scheme for review. No further action is required on your side.

There is no equivalent webhook because your action triggered the status change.

`lost`

The issuing bank has rejected your evidence and you have lost the dispute. There are no further financial implications.

`dispute_lost`

View a [dispute lost webhook example](/display/DOCS/dispute_lost).

`won`

The issuing bank has accepted your evidence and you have won the dispute. Your account has been credited back of the amount of the dispute.

`dispute_won`

View a [dispute won webhook example](/display/DOCS/dispute_won).

`expired`

The time limit to take action is met. There is no further implication and you can’t respond to the dispute anymore.

`dispute_expired`

View a [dispute expired webhook example](/display/DOCS/dispute_expired).

`accepted`

You have accepted the dispute. There is no further implication or action required.

There is no equivalent webhook because your action triggered the status change.

Respond to a dispute
--------------------

In order to win a dispute, you will need to provide relevant evidence to your case. This could be the invoice, the proof of delivery, or even customer communication regarding the payment that was charged back. You can use our API to upload evidence, review this evidence, and submit it when you're ready.

### Provide evidence 

Use the endpoint below to add supporting evidence to a dispute. Note that this only attaches the evidence to the dispute, it does not send it to us. Once ready, you will need to [submit it](#DisputesAPI-submitevidence) to us.

The type of evidence we recommend submitting [depends on the reason for the dispute](https://docs.checkout.com/risk-management/disputes#Disputes-Disputereasonsandrecommendedevidence).

If you wish to submit files as evidence, you will first need to upload them using the [file uploader API](/display/DOCS/File+uploader). This will give you a file `id` (prefixed by `file_`) which you can then use in your request.

#### Endpoints

*   [**Live**](#tabs-2924fc2c-eb6c-4c61-a895-160217df9641-1)
*   [**Sandbox**](#tabs-2924fc2c-eb6c-4c61-a895-160217df9641-2)

PUT`https://api.checkout.com/disputes/{dispute_id}/evidence`

PUT`https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/disputes/{dispute_id}/evidence`

  

If you run this request more than once, you will overwrite the previous request.

#### Additional parameters

You must provide at least one of the evidence types listed below in the body of your request. Each of the following can be provided as either a text string and/or a file ID previously uploaded. Simply specify it in your request as `{evidence_type}_file` or `{evidence_type}_text` (e.g., `proof_of_delivery_or_service_file`).

Text strings are limited to 500 characters because they should typically be used only as an addition to a file.
