Statements give you an overview of your payouts, as well as a more detailed rundown of your business activity, including processed amounts, refunds, chargebacks, fees and rolling reserves.

Learn more about each section of your statement below.

Dates and times in statements, including the period each statement covers, are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

## Value-added tax

Some of our merchants have their businesses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Since January 1, 2018, the UAE is applying a value-added tax (VAT) to all financial services. You can find your VAT invoice on a separate page for each business registered in the UAE.

### VAT invoice header

- **Label 2 - VAT number:** the merchant’s business VAT Number.

### VAT summary
