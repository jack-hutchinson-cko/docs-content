The Unified Payments solution provides you with a streamlined integration experience, with consolidated payment flows, simplified API responses, and a single `/payments` endpoint for all supported payment methods.

Unified Payments is SCA-ready

Our Unified Payments solution fully supports the new authentication standard – 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) – and automatically handles the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements introduced by the revised Payment Services Directive, providing your customers with a smoother, more secure checkout flow.

This migration guide will outline key concepts introduced in the Unified Payments solution and then provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to update your integration to use it.

We've answered some of the most frequently asked questions in our [Migration FAQ](/display/DOCS/Migration+FAQ).

If you need any additional support during the migration process, do not hesitate to [reach out to our Support team](mailto:support@checkout.com?subject=Migration query).

Single payments endpoint
------------------------

The Unified Payments solution provides a single payments endpoint supporting both new and existing payment methods. Whether you accept cards, alternative payment methods or digital wallets, all your payment requests will be sent to the same endpoint.

Payment sources
---------------

We now support securely storing multiple sources of payments, including cards and bank accounts. Each payment source will have a unique ID that can be used to make a payment request. Your existing card IDs can still be used when requesting a payment and you will be provided with the updated source ID in the payment response.

Payments and actions
--------------------

Payments replace what we previously referred to as a charge. A payment can have one or more actions that represent an interaction with a payment provider, for example Visa. This provides you with granular visibility into the lifecycle of a payment and a single ID that can be used to obtain the current status.

![](/download/attachments/5931137/payment-actions.png?version=1&modificationDate=1587553755700&api=v2)

Because any subsequent actions performed on a payment only requires you to reference the payment ID in your API call, it is the only identifier that you need to store for future use.

Updated SDKs
------------

As a part of the Unified Payments solution, we have introduced new SDKs for [.NET](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-sdk-net), [Python](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-sdk-python/tree/unified-payments), and [PHP](https://github.com/checkout/checkout-sdk-php) that may make your migration process even easier. 

Handling response codes
-----------------------

Captures, refunds and voids are performed asynchronously in the Unified Payments solution, meaning that you will get an HTTP status code of `202 - Accepted` in your API response rather than a `201 - Created`. To get final confirmation that these actions were performed successfully, we recommend that you use webhook notifications. API validation response codes (i.e., `7xxx` response codes) have also been replaced with more descriptive and user-friendly error codes. More details on this can be found [response codes](/display/DOCS/Response+codes).

We have also introduced an `approved` field to the request payment and retrieve payment responses to indicate whether the requested action was performed successfully. This provides you with a single field that you can rely on in your integration to confirm the outcome of the requested action.

3D Secure payments
------------------

When requesting a 3D Secure payment, the cardholder may need to be redirected to a separate page to authenticate themselves. If this is the case, you will receive an HTTP status code of `202 - Accepted` and a redirect link in the response’s hypermedia.

*   [**Payment response example**](#tabs-8f8199cf-8f5a-48fb-9e9b-e47a4fa030a2-2)

    {
      "source" : {
        "type" : "card",
        "number" : "4242424242424242",
        "expiry_year" : 2019,
        "expiry_month" : 03,
        "cvv" : "100"
      },
      "amount" : "2000",
      "currency" : "USD",
      "reference": "TRK12345",
      "3ds" : {
        "enabled": true,
      }
    }

    {
      "id": "pay_g3avvtweex5e7prna4vkupdkle",
      "status": "Pending",
      "reference": "TRK12345",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_mp6evgbj4bzevmnpxgsq7bdcgy"
      },
      "3ds": {
        "downgraded": false,
        "enrolled": "Y"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href":
    "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_g3avvtweex5e7prna4vkupdkle"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href":
    "https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/v2/3ds/acs/sid_vwipcigm6k2ubcvl2rzbovpysy"
        }
      } 
    }

Once the cardholder has been authenticated and is redirected back to your success or failure URL, we will provide a session ID in the URL that can be used to retrieve details of the payment.

If you instead receive an HTTP status of `201 - Created`, it means that it was processed successfully and does not require any further action to complete the processing.

Card token flow
---------------

### What doesn't change

*   Your existing front-end solution (e.g., Frames, [Checkout.js](/display/AR/Checkout.js), SDKs) can still be used to collect your customer's card information.
*   Checkout.com still returns a card token once your customer has confirmed the purchase.

Card ID flow
------------

### What doesn’t change

*   When a payment using a card token or full card details is made, the Unified Payments API provides an identifier for the tokenized card information in its response. This identifier, previous called a card ID, is now called a source ID.
*   This source ID can be used to make payments using its underlying card information.

Default card/customer flow
