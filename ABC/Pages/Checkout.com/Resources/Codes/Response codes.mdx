Response codes can tell you a lot about what happened during an API request. Checkout.com responds to API requests with:

*   an HTTP status code
*   a response object containing a `response_code` that indicates the status of the request, or an error object containing one or several `error_codes`

This page describes the response codes you might receive.

Overview
--------

A `response_code` is a five-digit numeric code that indicates the status of the request. Additional information on the request status may be found in the `response_summary` and `status` fields.

Code

Text

Description

30004

Pick up card (no fraud)

The cardholder’s bank has declined the payment. The customer should call their issuing bank and ask why the transaction was declined. Once the issuing bank confirms that they will approve future attempts, try the transaction again.

30007

Pick up card, special conditions

The cardholder’s bank has declined the payment because they have detected fraudulent activity on the account.

*   For a one-off transaction, do not attempt the transaction again, and, if possible, do not provide goods or services to the person attempting the transaction.
*   For a recurring or scheduled transaction, it is possible that the card was flagged after the last successfully processed payment (or after the authorization for the scheduled payment). In that case, contact your customer for a new credit card number, or ask for a different form of payment. Replace the old account number on the schedule with the new account number.

30015

No such issuer

The card number entered is invalid because it does not start with a `3` (Amex), `4` (Visa), `5` (Mastercard) or `6` (Discover). Double-check the credit card number and try the transaction again with the correct number.

We will usually flag this type of error before an authorization is attempted, but, in some rare cases (typically when there is an error with a payment import), this type of failure may occur.

*   For a recurring or scheduled transaction, it is possible that the card was lost after the last successfully processed payment (or after the authorization for the scheduled payment). In that case, contact your customer for a new credit card number, or ask for a different form of payment. Replace the lost account number on the schedule with the new account number

30043

Stolen card - pick up

30044

Transaction rejected - AMLD5

Transaction was initiated from an anonymous, non-reloadable prepaid card and for an amount greater than 50 EUR. Due to the AMLD5 directive, it cannot be fulfilled.

30045

Invalid payout fund transfer type

If the fund transfer type is not among the list that was configured for allowed fund transfer types, the transaction would fail.

30046

Closed account

The destination account is closed, and the transaction will never be approved, so do not reattempt the transaction. The cardholder must contact their issuing bank.
