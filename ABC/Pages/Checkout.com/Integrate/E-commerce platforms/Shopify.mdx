The Checkout.com payment gateway is fully integrated with Shopify. If you're already using Shopify, you can start accepting payments through our gateway by configuring a few simple settings.

Onsite or offsite options
-------------------------

You can accept payments through our gateway either **onsite**, where your customer enters their payment details on your website, or **offsite**, where they will be redirected to a Checkout.com page to do so.

The onsite option is available by default – you simply have to select it from your Shopify configuration menu.

If you want to use the offsite option, follow the instructions below.

Onsite: alternative payment methods

The onsite option does not currently support alternative payment methods.

Onsite: card payments

If you want to process card payments with the onsite option, please contact our Support team at [support@checkout.com](mailto:support@checkout.com) so we can enable them on your account.

Installation instructions (offsite option)
