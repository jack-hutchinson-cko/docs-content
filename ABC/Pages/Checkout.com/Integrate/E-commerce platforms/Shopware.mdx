Get started with our plugin for your Shopware webshop.

This guide assumes that you have already installed Shopware.

Before you start
----------------

### Create a test account

If you haven't already, [create a test Checkout.com account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account).

### Get your API keys 

To set up our Shopware plugin, you'll need your public and secret API keys, which are generated automatically upon account creation.

1.  Log in to your test account on the [Hub sandbox](https://sandbox.checkout.com/).
2.  In the left menu, go to _Settings > Channels_, and make a note of your secret and public API keys.![](/download/attachments/23003631/channel_settings.png?version=1&modificationDate=1618242727818&api=v2)
3.  Scroll down to the _Webhooks_ section of the page and click **New webhook**.
4.  Enter the following URL, replacing `example.com` with the URL of your shop: `example.com/CkoCheckoutWebhook`.
    
    Correctly configuring your webhooks is important; if they're incorrectly formatted, the plugin will not work.
    
5.  Select **API - v2.0**.
6.  Tick **Select all**, then click **Create webhook**.

7.  Click on the webhook you just created, and make a note of the private shared API key.
