From downloading the plugin to requesting your first test payment, learn how to get started with the Checkout.com for WooCommerce plugin.

This guide assumes that you have already [set up WooCommerce on your WordPress instance](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/installing-uninstalling-woocommerce/).

Before you start
----------------

### Create a test account

If you haven't already, [create a test Checkout.com account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account).

### Get your API keys

In order to set up WooCommerce, you'll need three API keys: a secret one, a public one, and a private shared one. The first two are generated automatically upon account creation. The last one is generated when you configure a webhook for your business.

You do not need your private shared key if using v4.2.0+ of our WooCommerce plugin.

1.  Log in to your test account on the [Hub sandbox](https://sandbox.checkout.com/).
2.  In the left menu, go to _Settings > Channels_, and make a note of your secret and public API keys.

3.  Scroll down to the _Webhooks_ section of the page and click **New webhook**.
4.  Enter the following endpoint URL, replacing `example.com` with the URL of your shop: `example.com/?wc-api=wc_checkoutcom_webhook`. **Note**: correctly configuring your webhooks is important; if they're incorrectly formatted, the plugin will not work.
5.  Select  **API - v2.0**.
6.  Tick  **Select all**, then click  **Create webhook**.

7.  Click on the webhook you just created, and make a note of the private shared API key.

Webhooks are notifications that we send when an event occurs on your account. For example, when a payment is captured. These are used by the WooCommerce plugin to update the status of an order. [Read more about webhooks](/display/DOCS/Webhooks).

### Check you have no previous version of the plugin

1.  Log in to WordPress as an administrator.
2.  In the left menu, click **Plugins**.
3.  Look for any plugins that have Checkout.com in the name. If you find one, click **Delete**, or click **Deactivate** and then **Delete**.

    *   Number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
