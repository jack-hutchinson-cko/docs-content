Enter your *Apple Merchant ID* and *Apple Merchant Name*. You'll find these in your Apple Developer account. 8. Enter the **Country Code** (the [two-letter ISO 3166 country code](/display/DOCS/Country+codes)) for your site's locale. 9. Check the **3DS** option in **Merchant** **Capabilities**, leaving the other options unchecked.0. Select the **Supported Networks**.1. Select the **Required Shipping Address Fields**.2.

Select whether to enable the automatic redirect of product detail pages to HTTPS.

    Pages where the Apple Pay button appears must be served via HTTPS, so you might need to redirect certain pages on your site.
    5.  Click **Submit**. A domain name should appear in the _Registration_ section. If you don't have an alias registered for your site, you'll see a domain similar like `staging-merchant.demandware.net` or `production-merchant.demandware.net`. If you do have an alias registered, the domain will be something like `mystore.com`.6.  Register your site with the Apple sandbox or production server. You only need one merchant ID to register with both servers. If your domain is registered with Apple sandbox, only devices signed in to an [iCloud Sandbox Tester Account](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store-connect/) can make payments on that site. If your domain is registered with the Apple production server, any regular iCloud account can pay on that site.
