Follow the steps below so you can start using your Shopware 5 plugin.

Install the plugin
------------------

There are two ways to install the plugin you need:

*   [Install using Composer](#Shopware5-composer)

Install using Composer 
-----------------------

### For basic settings

1.  Install and activate the plugin with the plugin manager.
2.  Reload the backend.
3.  Go to Configuration > Payment methods. Additional payment methods have been added with the prefix “cko” and you can now find the [Checkout.com](http://checkout.com/) Setup menu point.

If you want to see the activated payment methods in the frontend, you need to add your public and private key from [Checkout.com](http://checkout.com/) to the configuration.

In order to show Apple Pay, Google Pay, SEPA, credit card and PayPal in the front-end you need to configure the according payment method in the Checkout Setup.
