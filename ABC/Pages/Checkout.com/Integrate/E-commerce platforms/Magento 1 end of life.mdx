On 30 June 2020 [official support will end for all versions of Magento 1](https://magento.com/blog/magento-news/supporting-magento-1-through-june-2020). No further quality fixes or security patches will be released after this date.

If you are using Magento 1, you need to migrate to [Magento 2](/display/DOCS/Magento+2), or [another platform](/display/DOCS/E-commerce+platforms), before 30 June 2020.

If you don't, you risk security breaches, and you will no longer comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).

Which versions are affected?
----------------------------

**All versions of Magento 1 are affected** and will no longer be supported, including Magento Commerce 1 and Magento Open Source 1.

See the [Magento software lifecycle policy](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-software-lifecycle-policy.pdf).

Why do I need to migrate?
-------------------------

### Not compliant with PCI DSS

The PCI DSS, a [collection of security requirements](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=pcidss&document=pci_dss) set by the card schemes (like Visa and Mastercard), apply to all merchants that process payments. If you don't follow these standards, you can be fined by the card schemes.

[Card schemes have recommended urgent action](https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/global/support-legal/documents/acquirer-advisory-magento-migration.pdf), making clear that merchants who fail to migrate from Magento 1 by the end of June 2020 will fall out of compliance with PCI DSS and, as a result, may be subject to fines.

### Damage to your brand

With no future official upgrades and patches, websites remaining on Magento 1 may degrade and become unstable, making them increasingly vulnerable to data breaches and other security risks.

Not only would this damage your brand and reputation as you lose the trust of your customers, but you could also be fined in the case of a suspected breach.

What do I need to do?
---------------------

If you're using Magento 1, you must migrate to [Magento 2](/display/DOCS/Magento+2), or [another e-commerce platform](/display/DOCS/E-commerce+platforms), before 30 June 2020.
