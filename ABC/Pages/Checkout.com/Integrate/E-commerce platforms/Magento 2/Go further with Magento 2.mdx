5.  Click **Save Config**.

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand **Card Payments**.

    ![](/download/attachments/5931070/saved_card_payments.png?version=1&modificationDate=1587460379511&api=v2)
4.  Set _Vault Enabled_ to **Yes**.

8.  Set _Require CVV for saved cards_ to **Yes** if you want the customer to enter the three (or four) digit CVV when they pay with a saved card. This provides additional security against fraud. Select **No** if you're happy for the customer to pay with a saved card without entering the card's CVV.
9.  Click **Save Config**.

Enable MOTO payments 
---------------------

These settings allow the administrator of your account to carry out mail order / telephone order (MOTO) payments on your customers' behalf.

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand **MOTO Payments**.
2.  Set _MOTO Enabled_ to **Yes** if you want to allow your administrator to carry out MOTO payments.
3.  Specify what **Title** you want your customers to see when they select the MOTO payment option.
4.  Set _Saved Cards Enabled_ to **Yes** if you want to allow your administrator to make MOTO payments using customers' saved cards.
5.  Click **Save Config**.

Card payment options 
---------------------

To find these settings, log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand **Card Payments**.

#### Payment option title

Allows you to specify what title the customer will see when they choose to pay by card.

#### Display card icons

Set to **Yes** if you want to display card scheme logos to customers, and then select the particular scheme logos you want to display.

#### Enable Mada BIN check

Mada cards always require a CVV check, so make sure you set the _Require CVV for saved cards_ option to **Yes** in the _Card Payments_ settings. This will ensure that the customer is asked to enter the CVV when they make a payment with a saved Mada card.

Mada is a local card scheme in Saudi Arabia. If you are going to be processing Mada cards, you should set Enable MADA Bin Check to **Yes**.

When enabled, we check the card's BIN to see if the customer is using a Mada card, and then apply the necessary configuration before sending the payment request.

Enabling this feature will also mean all Mada card payment are auto-capture and 3DS authentication for requests.

Take a look at our [Mada guide](/display/DOCS/Mada) to find out more.

#### Payment form layout

Select your preferred layout for the payment form. **Single iframe** displays a one-line payment form. Multiple iframes displays a payment form of three fields. See our [Frames customization guide](/display/DOCS/Frames+customization+guide) for more information.

#### Payment form styles

Allows you to customize the payment form's look and feel. You can add CSS styles in JSON format to alter the form's appearance. For example: `{"base":{"color":"blue","fontSize":"18px"}}`. See our [Frames customization guide](/display/DOCS/Frames+customization+guide) for more information.

General payment options 
------------------------

To find these settings, log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand **Global Settings**.

#### Payment action

If you want to manually capture payments, rather than have payments automatically captured (the **Authorize and Capture** option), set _Payment Action_ to **Authorize**. Payments will now be authorized, but you will need to manually capture the payment afterwards.

#### Capture time

If you set the **Authorize and Capture** as the _Payment Action_, you can use this setting to specify the delay (in hours) before the payment is captured. For example, `1.500` for capture after one hour and 30 minutes; `0.010` for capture after 36 seconds. We don't recommend setting a value lower than `0.003` (10 seconds).

#### Dynamic descriptor

This is an extra field that you can send to the issuer, appearing on the customer's bank statement as an additional description of the payment.

1.  Set _Enable Dynamic Descriptor_ to **Yes** if you want to send this extra information. If not enabled, the shopper will just see your merchant name as it appears in your Hub account.
2.  Specify the **Descriptor Name**. This is the first line of the descriptor, usually your merchant name. You can use up to 25 characters.
3.  Specify the **Descriptor City**. This is the second line of the descriptor, usually the city of your merchant address. You can use up to 13 characters.  
    

Manually capture, void and refund payments 
-------------------------------------------

As well as doing so through the Hub, you can also manually capture, void, and refund payments from the Magento Admin Panel. These actions will show in both Magento and the Hub.

#### Manually capture payment

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand **Global Settings**.
2.  Make sure _Payment Action_ is set to **Authorize**.
3.  Once you've created an order, find it in _Sales > Orders_ in your Magento Admin Panel. It should have a `Pending Payment` status. Click **View** on the order.
4.  Click **Invoice**.
5.  Click **Submit Invoice** at the bottom of the page to complete and capture the payment.  
    

#### Void payment

You can only void payments that have been authorized but not yet captured.

1.  Log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel and expand **Global Settings**.
2.  Make sure _Payment Action_ is set to **Authorize**.
3.  Once you've created an order, find it in _Sales > Orders_ in your Magento Admin Panel. It should have a `Pending Payment` status. Click **View** on the order.
4.  Click **Void** to void the payment.  
    

#### Refund a payment

If refunding through Magento, we recommend you do so through the invoice for the order, rather than clicking **Credit Memo** from the order view. The latter only gives you a **Refund offline** option, which will not record the refund in your Hub account.

1.  Once you've created an order, log in to your Magento Admin Panel and find the order in _Sales > Orders_.
2.  If the payment wasn't captured automatically on authorization, capture the payment now. A captured payment will have a `Processing` status.
3.  Click **View** on the order.
4.  From the Invoices section of the order, click **Credit Memo**.
5.  Select the products you want to refund and click **Refund** (not **Refund offline**).

Order settings 
---------------

To find these settings, log in to your Magento Admin Panel, go to the Checkout.com plugin's configuration panel, click **Configuration** and then expand **Order Settings**.

#### Action on failed payment

Select the action you want to be taken on orders with failed payments. We recommend you choose **Cancel the order**. This will cancel the order where the payment fails, but still record it so you have a trace of all failed orders. If you choose **Delete the order**, it will delete any trace of the failed order, leaving no record of it.

#### Order confirmation email

Select at what point you want to send the customer an order confirmation email. **Authorize** will send an order confirmation email to the customer as soon as the payment is authorized. **Authorize and Capture** will send it only after the payment has been both authorized and captured.

#### Order statuses

These settings allow you edit the order statuses in line with the status of the payment. But they are automatically set to Magento's default values, so be aware that editing them may cause problems with the order flow.
