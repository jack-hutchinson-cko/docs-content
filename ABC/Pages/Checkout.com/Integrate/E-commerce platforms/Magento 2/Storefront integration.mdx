[Go to start of metadata](#page-metadata-start)

Follow this guide if you're building a storefront on top of a headless Magento 2 backend.

Once you've set up our [Magento 2 plugin](/display/DOCS/Magento+2) in the Magento back end, you're ready to start accepting payments through your own storefront.

To get started, follow Magento's [checkout tutorial](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql/tutorials/checkout/) until you get to step 9. Then, instead of following steps 9 and 10, use our request payment endpoint below to complete the order.

Request payment
---------------

Currently, this endpoint only accepts card payments (including [Mada](/display/DOCS/Mada)). We will add further functionality in due course.

The request

*   [**v3**](#tabs-484759c3-4f61-4f5e-8495-67615f63c2fd-1)

*   [**v1**](#tabs-484759c3-4f61-4f5e-8495-67615f63c2fd-3)
