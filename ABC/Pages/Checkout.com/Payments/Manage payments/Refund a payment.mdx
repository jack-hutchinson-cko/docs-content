Use a refund to return a payment to a customer. Refunds can be made in the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using this API endpoint.

There are two types of refunds you might need to process:

*   **Full refund**. A full refund returns the total amount of the payment to the customer — it can only be performed once.
*   **Partial refund**. A partial refund returns a sum less than the captured amount. A payment can be refunded multiple times, but cannot exceed the original payment amount.

Refunds are always processed in the same currency as the captured payment.

You cannot cancel a refund after it has been processed.

Overview
--------

To process a refund successfully, you must provide the payment ID of the captured payment. You can find the ID:

*   In the response of the payment request
*   In the webhook notification

The requests are the same for partial and full refunds. Any refunds for less than the original captured amount will be considered partial refunds.

### The POST request

Use the endpoint below to request a refund.

If required by the card scheme, we will trigger a [refund authorization](#Refundapayment-refundauthorization) before processing your refund.

### The POST response

#### Response examples

*   [**202 Refund accepted**](#tabs-46a72ad6-f331-4bb0-8bd7-0c68cc6e1a1b-1)
*   [**422 Invalid data was sent**](#tabs-46a72ad6-f331-4bb0-8bd7-0c68cc6e1a1b-2)

    {
      "action_id": "act_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44",
      "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89",
      "_links": {
        "payment": {
          "href": "https://api.checkout.com/payments/pay_y3oqhf46pyzuxjbcn2giaqnb44"
        }
      }
    }

    {
      "request_id": "0HL80RJLS76I7",
      "error_type": "request_invalid",
      "error_codes": [
        "payment_source_required"
      ]
    }

If unsuccessful, you may also receive a `403 Refund not allowed` or `404 Payment not found` error.

Refund authorization 
---------------------

If the card scheme requires it, we will automatically trigger a refund authorization on your behalf before processing your refund.

Refund authorizations only apply to card payments.

If a refund authorization is requested, you can find the Retrieval Reference Number (RRN) in [refund webhook notifications](/display/DOCS/Webhooks) and in the [get payment actions](/display/DOCS/Manage+payments) call.

If the refund authorization is declined, you will receive a 422 response, like the one below.

    {
       "request_id": "f5feff3f-d2ef-4c82-b4d0-ff443731581f",
       "error_type": "processing_error",
       "error_codes": [
           "refund_authorization_declined"
       ]
    }

If you want to know the reason for the decline, you can either [subscribe to refund webhook notifications](/display/DOCS/Webhooks), use our [get payment actions endpoint](/display/DOCS/Get+payment+actions), or view it in your [Hub](/display/DOCS/Manage+Hub+payments) account.

Testing

To test a declined refund authorization, request a refund with the `amount` set to `3738`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If your refund request was unsuccessful, the checklist below may help you identify the problem:

*   Is the refund amount higher than the original payment?
*   Has the payment already been refunded?
*   Did you send the authorization ID instead of the payment ID?
