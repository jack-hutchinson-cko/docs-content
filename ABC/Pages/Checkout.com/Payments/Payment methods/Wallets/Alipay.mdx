To start accepting Alipay payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

Overview
--------

Alipay payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request an Alipay payment](#Alipay-requestapayment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](#Alipay-redirectthecustomer)

POST`https://api.checkout.com/payments`

POST`https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments`

#### Header parameters

Header

Value

`Authorization`

REQUIRED

`secret key`

Use the valid secret key of your Checkout.com account. You can find this in the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2)

`Content-Type`

REQUIRED

`application/json`

#### Body parameters

The table below describes the minimum recommended fields. You can find the full list, as well as complete request and response examples, in our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post).

Field name

Description

`source`

REQUIRED

STRING

Details about the payment source.

`source.type`

REQUIRED

STRING

The type of payment source. Set this to `alipay`.

`amount`

OPTIONAL

INTEGER

The payment amount.

`currency`

REQUIRED

STRING

The currency in which the payment is being made (three-letter ISO 4217 code).

Currently, we only support USD.

#### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "alipay"
      },
     "amount": 2000,
     "currency": "USD"
    }
    

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

### The POST response

If a payment `id` is returned, then your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_wu2hdjkzookuji3i2xai2ienlm",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_j4o4tigv4vaebednks3gafrwk4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/payments/pay_wu2hdjkzookuji3i2xai2ienlm"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108674"
        }
      }
    }

### Redirect the customer 

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an Alipay payment is communicated only through webhooks. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

Refund a payment

Alipay supports both partial and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or using the [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Cancel a payment
----------------

If the customer cancels or fails to complete the transaction at any point after the payment is created, it will automatically be voided, and we'll send you a `payment_voided` webhook.

Testing Alipay
--------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Alipay payments in the sandbox environment.

1.  Create an Alipay transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to Alipay's website.
2.  Click the button on the right and log in with the following details:
    *   **Username**: `alipaytest20091@gmail.com`
    *   **Password**: `111111`
3.  Solve the captcha and then click the blue button at the bottom of the form to continue.
4.  Enter `111111` into the box and then click the blue button to complete the payment. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
