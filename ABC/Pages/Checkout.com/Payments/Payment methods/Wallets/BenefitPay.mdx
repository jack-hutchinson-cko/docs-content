      "id": "pay_aeb7fegfsihejgpeeby36rrf3y",

      }
    }

Display the QR code 
--------------------

To capture the pending payment, you will need to display the associated QR code to your customer for them to scan with the BenefitPay mobile app.

To do this you will need to get the QR code data, convert that into a QR code and then display it on your payment page.

### Get QR code data

Use the details below to get the `source.qr_data`.

        }
      }
    }

Create and display the QR code
------------------------------

Now take the `source.qr_data` obtained in the previous step and turn it into a QR code (via an API or your own implementation). You should then display this on your payment page so the customer can scan it with their BenefitPay mobile app and complete the transaction.

Once the customer has completed the payment by scanning the QR code, we will send you a `payment_captured` webhook notification to confirm the success of the payment.

Refunds and chargebacks
-----------------------

BenefitPay has no native support for refunds. If you want to refund a customer who has made a BenefitPay payment, we recommend that you make the refund using a standard bank transfer.

In addition, there is no chargeback mechanism for BenefitPay.

Webhooks
--------

When using BenefitPay, you may receive the following webhooks.
