## Testing PayPal

To start testing, you'll need to:

- [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
- contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate PayPal payments in the sandbox environment.
  . Create a PayPal transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to PayPal's website.

2.  Log in with your PayPal username and password.
3.  Set the payment status – pending, paid, or refused – and then click **Confirm**. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
