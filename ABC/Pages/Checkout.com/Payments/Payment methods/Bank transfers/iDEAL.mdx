        "bic":"INGBNL2A",
        "description": "ORD50234E89",
        "language": "nl"
      },
      "amount": 2000,
      "currency": "EUR"
    }

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

### The POST response

If a payment id is returned, then your request was successful.

#### Example response

    {
      "id": "pay_yndlioum4gau3oizxihvzdgp4i",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_erquvsbcz2xunm5rrwd5clyfiy"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_yndlioum4gau3oizxihvzdgp4i"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/108659"
        }
      }
    }

## Redirect the customer 

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

For security reasons, iDEAL forbids using custom-made in-app browsers for redirection. We recommend that you open the device’s default browser to display the redirect. If you do want to use an in-app web view, you must use [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) for iOS or [Chrome Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/customtabs) for Android.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an iDEAL payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as *Pending*.

## Get details about a payment

You can use the `payment_id` found in the payment response, or the `cko-session-id` from the success/failure URL (e.g., `https://www.checkout.com/order/succeeded?cko-session-id=**sid_vii64oquze5u3h2x6hh4rurc4y**`) to retrieve details about the payment.

The `cko-session-id` expires 15 minutes after being created.
