The type of payment source. Set this to `poli`.

        "type": "poli"
      },
      "amount": 111,
      "currency": "AUD"
    }

If a customer ID or email is not provided in the request, then we automatically create a customer profile and return the customer `id` in the response.

### The POST response

If a payment `id` is returned, then your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_nlj7cdwepelutidihyaeexyzae",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_qsbi7c2lnkbu5dhkkaci76xdh4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_nlj7cdwepelutidihyaeexyzae"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.checkout.com/LP.Core/api/payment/109457"
        }
      }
    }

Redirect the customer 
----------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the above response. The redirect transfers the customer to their bank's website where they are required to enter their authorization details; if successful, the payment can be approved.

Once completed, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of a Poli payment is **communicated only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as _Pending_.

Cancel a payment
----------------

If the customer cancels or fails to complete the transaction at any point after the payment is created, it will automatically be voided, and we'll send you a `payment_voided` webhook.

------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Poli payments in the sandbox environment.

1.  Create a Poli transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to Poli's website.
2.  Select **iBank AU 01** from the dropdown menu and click **Continue**.
