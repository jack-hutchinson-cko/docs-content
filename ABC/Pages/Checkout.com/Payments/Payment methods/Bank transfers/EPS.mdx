### The POST response

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, then your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_wqvd2nukz5dujnmokm7ljhymwa",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_uvs2lu4b7ncurjx5zdtrixnc4e"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_wqvd2nukz5dujnmokm7ljhymwa"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://ftg-customer-integration.giropay.de/ftgbank/b/bankselection/2329733103475232793;jsessionid=6CA094B861DC4D16D1C48D1988DE4A32.sf-testapp02tom24?op=001"
        }
      }
    }

## Redirect the customer 

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will send them to an EPS bank selection page where they will select their bank before being transferred to that bank's page to enter their authorization details. If successful, the payment can be approved.

Once they've completed this step, the customer is transferred to your predefined success or failure URL. Confirmation of an EPS payment is communicated **only through webhooks**. When you receive a `payment_captured` webhook notification, the transaction has been completed successfully. Until the `payment_captured` webhook is received (response code `10000`), all payments are labeled as *Pending*.

2.  Select the bank:
