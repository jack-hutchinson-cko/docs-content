#### Body parameters

The table below describes the minimum recommended fields. You can find the full list, as well as complete request and response examples, in our [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post).

Field name

Description

Field name

Description

`amount`

REQUIRED

INTEGER

The payment amount

`currency`

REQUIRED

STRING

The currency in which the payment is being made (three-letter ISO 4217 code). Set this to `KWD`.

`source`

REQUIRED

OBJECT

Details about the payment source.

`source.type`

REQUIRED

STRING

The type of payment source. Set this to `knet`.

`source.language`

REQUIRED

STRING

The customer's preferred language (two-letter ISO code). Set this to either `ar` (Arabic) or `en` (English).

`source.user_defined_field1`

OPTIONAL

STRING

You can use this to pass and store any additional transaction data you wish to archive with the transaction and make available as searching criteria.

<= 255 characters. Alphanumeric characters and spaces only.

`source.user_defined_field2`

OPTIONAL

STRING

You can use this to pass and store any additional transaction data you wish to archive with the transaction and make available as searching criteria.

<= 255 characters. Alphanumeric characters and spaces only.

`source.user_defined_field3`

OPTIONAL

STRING

  

You can use this to pass and store any additional transaction data you wish to archive with the transaction and make available as searching criteria. 

Omit this field if you include `source.card_token` in your request, because the latter is passed to the KNET gateway as `udf3`.

<= 255 characters. Alphanumeric characters and spaces only.

`source.card_token`

OPTIONAL

STRING

This token (an eight-digit token generated by the merchant) allows you to re-use card details for multiple payments. When a subsequent payment is initialized with the same card token, the customer will be presented with two options: pay with KFast (where they don't need to enter their card details again), or with KNET as usual.

If you include this in your request, `source.user_defined_field3` must be empty, because they share a KNET API field.

`source.user_defined_field4`

OPTIONAL

STRING

You can use this to pass and store any additional transaction data you wish to archive with the transaction and make available as searching criteria.

<= 255 characters. Alphanumeric characters and spaces only.

`source.user_defined_field5`

OPTIONAL

STRING

  

You can use this to pass and store any additional transaction data you wish to archive with the transaction and make available as searching criteria.

Omit this field if you include `source.ptlf` in your request, because the latter is passed to the KNET gateway as `udf5`.

<= 255 characters. Alphanumeric characters and spaces only.

`source.ptlf`

OPTIONAL

STRING

This is an ID for merchant PTLF functionality tracking. The value will appear on the bank statement.

If you include this in your request, `source.user_defined_field5` must be empty, because they share a KNET API field.

When sending a payment request that includes `source.card_token`, the option to pay via KFast is offered. If the token is new, the first payment will happen via the usual flow, but with the option to "register for KFast" before submitting. This flow is **not testable in the sandbox environment** because the registration for KFast requires the customer to enter a one-time password sent to the mobile phone number registered with the bank, which is not present in sandbox.

#### Request example

    {
      "amount": 1000,
      "currency": "KWD",
      "source": {
        "type": "knet",
        "language": "en",
        "user_defined_field1": "first user defined field",
        "user_defined_field2": "second user defined field",
        "card_token": "01234567",
        "user_defined_field4": "fourth user defined field",
        "ptlf": "96033587c7b5"
      }
    }
    

### The POST response

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_4gubyq2w335upc54dx7a4257lq",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_r3cajfpbj3ju7jyq7afcg3qc4a"
      },

        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_4gubyq2w335upc54dx7a4257lq"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sbapi.ckotech.co/knet-external/redirect/tok_tl6kftlhdpzephqelsbpyovl4i/pay"
        }
      }
    }
    

Redirect the customer
---------------------

Redirect your customer to the `redirect` link’s href in the response. This will allow the customer to authorize the payment, before they are transferred to your predefined success or failure URL.

Refund a payment
----------------

KNET supports full, partial and multiple partial refunds. Refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using our [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Before you can refund KNET payments, you need to contact your bank and ask them to enable refunds. Your bank will then send a request to KNET to activate the refund API.

Cancel a payment
----------------

If, after landing on the KNET payment page, the customer attempts to complete the payment after seven minutes, we will automatically void the payment and send a `payment_expired` webhook.

If the customer cancels their payment, we will send a `payment_canceled` webhook.

Testing KNET
------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate KNET payments in the sandbox environment.

1.  Create a KNET transaction as above, following the redirect link in the response to KNET's website.
2.  Enter the following details:
    1.  **Select your bank**: Knet Test Card \[KNET1\]
    2.  **Card number**:  `888888 000 000 000 1`
    3.  **Expiration date**: `09 | 2021`
    4.  **PIN**: `1234`
3.  Click **Submit** and then click **Confirm**. You should then be redirected to your predefined success URL.
