Start accepting payment using Rapipago, a favorite payment method in Argentina.

If you want to use a gateway model for accepting Rapipago payments, you will need to arrange an agreement with our provider, dLocal, and create merchant details (specifically, `x_login` and `x_trans_key`) and a secret key with them. Share these details with our Customer Support team and we'll get you up and running. If you have already been onboarded for one of our other dLocal payment methods, you can use the same credentials.

Overview
--------

Rapipago payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request payment](#Rapipago-requestpayment)
2.  [Redirect the customer](#Rapipago-redirect)

#### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "rapipago",
        "integration_type": "redirect",
        "country": "AR",
        "payer": {
          "name": "Bruce Wayne",
          "email": "bruce@wayne-enterprises.com"
        },
        "description": "simulate Rapipago Demo Payment"
      },
      "amount": 100,
      "currency": "ARS"
    }

### The POST response

You should get a `202` response with the `status` field set to `Pending`. This means your request has been accepted.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_274nqq3v2vqura6oirwlupvpuu",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_2l5rigg64jqu5d76rmsa4jbuu4"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_274nqq3v2vqura6oirwlupvpuu"
        },
        "redirect": {
          "href": "https://sandbox.dlocal.com/collect/pay/pay/M-edadd4c6-18d4-4e59-873d-84c361a2d98c?xtid=CATH-ST-1588001175-803994443"
        },
        "simulator:payment-succeed": {
          "href": "http://sb-gateway-internal.cko.lon/dlocal-internal/rapipago/payments/pay_274nqq3v2vqura6oirwlupvpuu/succeed"
        },
        "simulator:payment-expire": {
          "href": "http://sb-gateway-internal.cko.lon/dlocal-internal/rapipago/payments/pay_274nqq3v2vqura6oirwlupvpuu/expire"
        }
      }
    }

### Step 2: Redirect the customer 

To capture and complete the payment, you need to provide the customer with the Rapipago ticket.

Using the redirection URL returned in the response above via `_links.redirect`, redirect your customer to the static, hosted Rapipago ticket page. Once redirected, your customer should save or print the ticket.

Make sure your customer is aware that they will be redirected to the ticket page when they click your "Pay now" button, and that they should print or save the ticket.

A button on the page will allow them to return to your shop:

*   If the ticket is still valid, they will be redirected to your success URL.
*   If the ticket has expired, they will be redirected to your failure URL.

Your payment confirmation page should make it clear to the customer that their purchase has not yet been completed. Explain that it has been reserved and is pending payment before the order can be completed and the goods/services can be delivered.

### Get details about a payment 

Using the following endpoint, pass the payment `id` (for example, `pay_hcklpcd45ymepcr7thciirbdaa`) from the payment response to get details about the payment.

Refunds and chargebacks
-----------------------

### Refund a payment

You can refund a Rapipago payment using our [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment). Partial and multiple – as well as full – refunds are allowed.

The customer will get an email (the email address is taken from the `source.payer.email` property in the initial payment request) from dLocal asking for their banking details. Once the customer has provided their details, dLocal will transfer the money to the customer's bank account.

The payment status will update to `refunded` and you will receive a `payment_refunded` (or `payment_refund_declined`, if unsuccessful) webhook notification.

A refund processing fee may apply.

### Chargebacks

There is no chargeback mechanism for Rapipago.

Testing
-------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Rapipago payments in the sandbox environment.

In your sandbox environment, you can test payment capture and expiration, as well as refund success and failure.

In order to test these actions, pass the string `"simulate"` as part of the `source.description` field in the initial payment request.

When you do, you will receive additional hypermedia links in the `_links` object in the payment response and in the 'get payment details' response.

Use the URLs contained in the `simulator:payment-succeed`, `simulator:payment-expire`, `simulator:refund-succeed` and `simulator:refund-fail` hypermedia objects to simulate the respective action/state change on the test payment.
