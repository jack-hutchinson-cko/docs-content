Start accepting payments using Fawry, the dominant payment method in Egypt.

Shoppers can now make Fawry payments via the myFawry app ([App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/myfawry/id1462911630?l=en) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fawry.myfawry&hl=en&gl=US)), rather than having to take their payment reference to a shop or ATM, meaning a better payment experience for both you and your customers.

To start accepting Fawry payments, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

#### Request example

      "source": {
        "type": "fawry",
        "description": "Fawry Demo Payment",
        "customer_mobile": "01058375055",
        "customer_email": "bruce@wayne-enterprises.com",
        "products": [
          {
            "product_id": "0123456789",
            "quantity": 1,
            "price": 1000,
            "description": "Fawry Demo Product"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

### The POST response

If you receive a `202 Success` response containing a `status` field set to `Pending`, your request was successful.

In addition, you will receive `payment_pending` and `payment_capture_pending` webhook notifications. And, when the customer completes the Fawry payment in a timely manner at a point of sale, you will get a `payment_captured` webhook notification to confirm that the payment has completed.

#### Response example

    {
      "id": "pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy",
      "status": "Pending",
      "customer": {
        "id": "cus_v65kd7q5tojehd23eftbaiktru"
      },
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy"
        }
      }
    }

Payment capture, expiration and cancellation

The payment will remain pending for the duration that you agreed when you onboarded your business with Fawry, or until the date and time you set for `expires_on`. If the customer fails to complete the transaction at a point of sale by then, the payment will expire and you will receive a `payment_expired` webhook notification. If, for any reason, the payment gets canceled before being captured or expiring, you will receive the `payment_canceled` webhook notification instead. Make sure that your products and/or services are not shipped and/or provided before receiving confirmation of the capture.

          "href": "https://api.sandbox.checkout.com/payments/pay_xksrrfuzksge5gyyqubpgbn7gy"
        }
      }
    }

Refund a payment
----------------

Fawry supports both partial (see note below for details) and full refunds. You can refund a payment through the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2) or by using the [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment).

Only **one refund action** may be taken on a Fawry payment, meaning that if you carry out a partial refund, you cannot then refund any more, even if there is some amount left. In addition, Fawry **refunds are always rounded down** to the nearest whole number. For example, attempting to refund a payment amount of 10999 (EGP 109.99) will only refund 10900 (EGP 109.00).

Testing Fawry
-------------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Fawry payments in the sandbox environment.

  

The following endpoints are for **testing purposes only**. They will not work in the live environment.

  

You can use the two following endpoints to test capturing and canceling a payment in our sandbox environment.
