Start accepting payment using Pago Fácil, a favorite payment method in Argentina.

  

If you want to use a gateway model for accepting Pago Fácil payments, you will need to arrange an agreement with our provider, dLocal, and create merchant details (specifically, `x_login` and `x_trans_key`) and a secret key with them. Share these details with our Customer Support team and we'll get you up and running. If you have already been onboarded for one of our other dLocal payment methods, you can use the same credentials.

Overview
--------

Pago Fácil can be used by either redirecting the customer to a statically hosted ticket (`redirect` integration method) or by rendering the complete ticket within your own checkout flow (`direct` integration method).

Payments follow a two-step process:

1.  [Request payment](#PagoFácil-requestpayment)
2.  [Redirect the customer or render the ticket](#PagoFácil-redirectorrender)

        }
      }
    }

Step 2: Redirect the customer or render the ticket 
---------------------------------------------------

To capture and complete the payment, you need to provide the customer with a Pago Fácil ticket by following one of two flows:

*   If you used the `redirect` method, [redirect the customer](#PagoFácil-redirect).
*   If you used the `direct` method, [render the ticket](#PagoFácil-render).

### Redirect the customer 

When using the `redirect` integration method, make sure your customer is aware that they will be redirected to the ticket page when they click your **Pay now** button, and that they should print or save the ticket.

Using the redirection URL returned in the response above via `_links.redirect`, redirect your customer to the static, hosted Pago Fácil ticket page. Once redirected, your customer should save or print the ticket.

A button on the page will allow them to return to your shop:

*   If the ticket is still valid, they will be redirected to your success URL.
*   If the ticket has expired, they will be redirected to your failure URL.

Your payment confirmation page should make it clear to the customer that their purchase has not yet been completed. Explain that it has been reserved and is pending payment before the order can be completed and the goods/services can be delivered.

### Render the ticket 

Redirect your customer to your payment confirmation page, where you should summarize their order and render the Pago Fácil ticket so they can complete the payment.

Your payment confirmation page should make it clear to the customer that their purchase has not yet been completed. Explain that it has been reserved and is pending payment before the order can be completed and the goods/services can be delivered.

To get the components necessary to render the ticket, use the ['get payment details' endpoint](#PagoFácil-getdetails) below. This will return a `ticket` object which contains the components to display the ticket.

Tips for displaying the ticket

*   Separate the _ticket number_ into two groups of four digits (for example: `1234 - 1234`). It makes it easier for customers to dictate it to cashiers.
*   Include the _currency_ and _amount_ on the ticket.
*   Make sure the _expiry date_ is clear and visible, and use the `dd/mm/yyyy` format.
*   Make it clear to the customer that _their payment will be credited immediately_.
*   Include _payment instructions_ to help customers unfamiliar with the payment process.
*   A _store locator_ is a helpful feature. Just link it to [google.com/maps/search/pagofacil/](https://www.google.com/maps/search/pagofacil).
*   Include a _save button_ so customers can easily save the ticket on their phone.
*   Include a _print button_ for customers who want to print their ticket.
*   As a fallback, the `ticket` object should also contain the URL to the static, hosted Pago Fácil ticket.

Refunds and chargebacks
-----------------------

### Refund a payment

You can refund a Pago Fácil payment using our [refund API](/display/DOCS/Refund+a+payment). Partial and multiple – as well as full – refunds are allowed.

The customer will get an email (the email address is taken from the `source.payer.email` property in the initial payment request) from dLocal asking for their banking details. Once the customer has provided their details, dLocal will transfer the money to the customer's bank account.

The payment status will update to `refunded` and you will receive a `payment_refunded` (or `payment_refund_declined`, if unsuccessful) webhook notification.

A refund processing fee may apply.

### Chargebacks

There is no chargeback mechanism for Pago Fácil.

Testing
-------

To start testing, you'll need to:

*   [create a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account), and
*   contact your Customer Success Manager or Integrations engineer to activate Pago Fácil payments in the sandbox environment.

In your sandbox environment, you can test payment capture and expiration, as well as refund success and failure.

In order to test these actions, pass the string `"simulate"` as part of the `source.description` field in the initial payment request.

When you do, you will receive additional hypermedia links in the `_links` object in the payment response and in the 'get payment details' response.

Use the URLs contained in the `simulator:payment-succeed`, `simulator:payment-expire`, `simulator:refund-succeed` and `simulator:refund-fail` hypermedia objects to simulate the respective action/state change on the test payment.

You can only test the `direct` payment flow in sandbox.
