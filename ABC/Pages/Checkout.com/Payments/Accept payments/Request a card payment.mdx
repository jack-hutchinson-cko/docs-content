Once you've successfully set up your integration, you're able to start receiving and tokenizing your customers' card details. After this tokenization process, you're ready to create a payment. To do this, you can use our API and your server-side code.

How it works
------------

![](/download/attachments/5931075/Card%20token.png?version=1&modificationDate=1619631646512&api=v2)

Card tokens (`tok_`) are single use and only have a 15-minute lifespan. Once you've successfully sent your request, you'll receive a response containing a permanent card source ID (`src_`) which can be used in subsequent payment requests.

Value

`Authorization`

REQUIRED

`secret key`

Use the valid secret key of your Checkout.com account. You can find this in the [Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/v2).

`Content-Type`

REQUIRED

`application/json`

#### Body parameters

The table below describes the minimum recommended fields. For the full API specification, see the [API reference](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post).

Field name

Description

Field name

Description

`source`

REQUIRED

OBJECT

Details about the payment source.

`source.type`

REQUIRED

STRING

The type of payment source. Set this to `token`.

`source.token`

REQUIRED

STRING

The Checkout.com token. This could be for a card, wallet, or alternative payment method.

`amount`

OPTIONAL

INTEGER

The payment amount in your chosen currency. Omit the amount or provide a value of `0` to perform a [card verification](/display/DOCS/Card+verification).

The format depends on the currency. For more information, see [calculating the value](/display/DOCS/Calculating+the+value).

`currency`

REQUIRED

STRING

A three-letter ISO currency code representing the currency of the payment.

`reference`

OPTIONAL

STRING

An optional reference you can use to identify the payment later. For example, an order number.

If using Bambora as a third-party acquirer, this field is numeric only and limited to 12 characters maximum.

`metadata`

OPTIONAL

OBJECT

Allows you to store additional information about a transaction (e.g., a coupon code) with custom fields and up to five user-defined fields (`udf1` to `udf5`), which can be used for reporting purposes.

`udf1` is also used for some of our risk rules.

IPv4 or IPv6 addresses?

The optional `[payment_ip](https://api-reference.checkout.com/#tag/Payments/paths/~1payments/post)` field, which is used by our risk engine to check the customer's IP address, _only accepts IPv4 addresses_.

#### Request example

    {
      "source": {
        "type": "token",
        "token": "tok_4gzeau5o2uqubbk6fufs3m7p54"
      },
      "amount": 6500,
      "currency": "USD",
      "reference": "ORD-5023-4E89",
      "metadata": {
        "udf1": "TEST123",
        "coupon_code": "NY2018",
        "partner_id": 123989
      }
    }

### The POST response

Use the `approved` field to check whether or not the authorization was successful (`"approved": true`). If your authorization was not successful, it's possible the payment used an invalid/expired card, or a valid card with an insufficient available balance.

If you received a `202` response, the payment requires a redirect. For example, if the payment is 3D Secure.

The following pages can help you understand the response message:

*   [CVV codes and descriptions](/display/DOCS/CVV+response+codes)
*   [AVS codes](/display/DOCS/AVS+codes)
*   [Response codes](/display/DOCS/Response+codes) (if the authorization was unsuccessful)

#### Response example

The possible values for the `status` field include `Authorized`, `Captured`, `Card Verified`, `Declined`, and `Pending`. Note that `Pending` only applies to 3D Secure payments and alternative payments.

*   [**201 Success**](#tabs-781ba643-57d4-47fa-ac88-f4dca24f2b4d-1)

Possibly fraudulent authorization requests return the message `risk.flagged: true` to show that the payment has been [flagged](/display/DOCS/Flagged+payments).

Next step
---------

Once you've successfully processed a card payment request, you're able to easily [reuse those card details](/display/DOCS/Use+an+existing+card) for subsequent payments.
