Find out more about the Hub and what it can do for you. If you haven't got an account yet, [sign up for a test account](https://www.checkout.com/get-test-account) now.

Log in
------

![](/download/attachments/2785615/hub-login.png?version=1&modificationDate=1586437665813&api=v2)

There are two environments for you to choose from when logging in to the Hub:

*   the live environment
*   the sandbox environment

The _live_ environment enables you to monitor your business's performance in real time. You can access your live environment by clicking [here](https://hub.checkout.com/login).

The _sandbox_ environment allows you to safely try out the Hub's features. For example, you can create payments using our [test cards](/display/DOCS/Test+card+numbers)—without running the risk of actually charging a customer. You can access your sandbox environment by clicking [here](https://sandbox.checkout.com/login).

If you are logging in for the first time, you will need to set a password for your account. Your login details will be the same for both the live and sandbox environments.

Navigate the Hub
----------------

Getting around the Hub is really easy—just click an icon in the sidebar to access the corresponding screen.

If your display is on the smaller side, click **Collapse sidebar** at the bottom of the left menu to give the content more space. You can always revert back to the standard view by clicking the icon again.

### Business / channel selector

If you have multiple business channels, the Hub will combine and display data for all of them by default. To view data related to a specific business channel, click the drop-down menu in the top left and choose a business channel.

### Date selector

By default, the Hub displays today’s data in the _Dashboard_, _Payments_, and _Customers_ screens.

If you want to view older data, click **Date filter** in the top right then select a date or date range. To select a date range, click on the start date then click on the end date. Your selected date range will be highlighted in green.

The Hub will temporarily save this date filter for you, so you can switch from one screen to another without having to set it again. It will automatically set the default back to today’s date next time you log in.

About the dashboard
-------------------

The dashboard is the first thing you see when you log in to the Hub. It allows you to check how your business is doing at a glance. You can review your key performance indicators, refunds, disputes, payment methods and currencies.

Dashboard display currency and timezone

You can change the dashboard display currency in the _Settings_ screen. Note that this won’t affect the processing and payouts currency displayed in any other areas of the Hub. You can also change the display timezone, though reports downloaded within the _Reports_ section will always use a UTC timestamp.

About the key performance indicators
------------------------------------

The key performance indicators (KPIs) provide you with an at-a-glance overview of how your business is performing.

The following table describes each KPI displayed in the Hub:
