Statements are an easy way to view the processed amount, refunds, chargebacks, processing fees, rolling reserve moments, and general adjustments for a given period.

About statements
----------------

Unlike [reports](/display/DOCS/Generate+reports), statements are automatically created based on your payout frequencies. The _Statements_ screen allows you to download all previously created statements.

If you're an administrator, you can view your current payout frequencies in the _Settings_ screen, under _Payouts_. To make any changes to your payouts, please contact your Customer Success manager.

Payout statuses

The _Status_ column informs you of the current status of the payout for each statement.
