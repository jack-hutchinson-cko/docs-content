A **Declined - Do Not Honour** notification is a request status associated with the **20005** response code, and it means that the customer's card issuing bank has declined the transaction. This is the most common message provided by card-issuing banks when a transaction fails their authorization process. There are instances when the transaction declines because of failed CVV or AVS checks. It is best to verify the accuracy of these fields before proceeding to the sections below.

The issuing bank provides no further details regarding the transaction failure, and Checkout.com is unable to override the decline response.

There are several possible scenarios that can trigger the **20005** (Declined - Do Not Honour) response code: 1. The bank's fraud rules consider various factors that are not made public. 2. The issuing bank may have placed a temporary hold on the customer's card. 3. The purchase session may have been locked due to multiple declined transactions. 4. The seller is located in a country different from that of the card issuing bank.

To reach a swift resolution to a **20005** (Declined - Do Not Honour) response scenario, please consider the following options: 1. Ask the customer to contact their bank, explaining that they are trying to process a payment. The customer can ask the bank to allow the transaction. 2. Ask the customer to try again at a later time. The issuing bank may have only placed a temporary hold on the card. 3. Ask the customer to use an alternative credit card.
