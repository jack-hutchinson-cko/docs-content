With our Salesforce Commerce Cloud installation, you can quickly start accepting payments on the Checkout.com payment gateway. 

In order to use this extension, you need to be using Salesforce Commerce Cloud 16.2 or above. 

Click \[here\](https://www.salesforce.com/products/commerce-cloud/partner-marketplace/partners/checkout-com/) to download the \`int\_checkoutcom\` cartridge from the LINK Marketplace. You will be prompted to enter your Salesforce credentials. 

Upload \`int\_checkoutcom\` to your server, using a tool like UX Studio or Webdav. Apply the standard flow used to upload cartridges to your environment. 

1\. In the \*Business Manager\*, go to \*\*Administration > Sites > Manage Sites\*\*. 2. In your target site’s settings, add \`int\_checkoutcom\` to the cartridge path like in the following example:
