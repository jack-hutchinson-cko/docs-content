\*Find out all you need to know about the status and history of a payment by using our payment history API. \* The payment history API provides a quick way to view the status of a payment without the need to search through webhooks. This is a great way to quickly find out if a payment has been successfully \[captured\](ref:post_payments-id-captures), \[refunded\](doc:refund), \[voided\](doc:void) or more. ## The request Payment history is retrieved by sending a \*\*GET\*\* API request to the URI below. In the URI, replace \*\*{chargeId}\*\* with the \`chargeId\` of the \*\*transaction\*\*, however, first \*\*add the prefix\*\* \`charge\_\` or \`charge_test\_\` to your Id. ### Endpoint live <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="get-tag">GET</span> https://api2.checkout.com/v2/charges/{chargeId}/history </p></pre> ### Endpoint sandbox <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="get-tag">GET</span> https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/v2/charges/{chargeId}/history </p></pre> ### Header and path parameters
