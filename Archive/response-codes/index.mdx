Pick Up Card (No Fraud) The customer’s issuing bank has prevented the transaction from being authorized. Have your customer call their issuing bank (the number is typically printed on the back of the credit card) and ask why the transaction was declined. Once the issuing bank confirms that they will approve future attempts, try the transaction again.

|
|

30007

|

Pick Up Card, Special Conditions The customer’s issuing bank has prevented the transaction from being authorized because fraudulent activity has been detected on this account. For a one time transaction, do not attempt the transaction again, and if possible do not provide goods or services to the person attempting the transaction. For a recurring or scheduled transaction, it is possible that the card was flagged after the last successfully processed payment (or after the authorization for the scheduled payment). In that case, contact your customer for a new credit card number, or ask for a different form of payment. Replace the old account number on the schedule with the new account number.

|
|

30015

|

No Such Issuer The card number entered is invalid because it does not start with a 3 (AMEX), 4 (Visa), 5 (MasterCard) or 6 (Discover). Double check the credit card number and try the transaction again with a corrected card number. NOTE: Checkout.com is designed to flag this type of error before an authorization attempt is made. However, in some rare cases (typically when there is an error with a payment import) this type of failure may occur.

Lost Card - Pick Up The customer’s issuing bank has prevented the transaction from being authorized because the card’s rightful owner has reported it as lost. For a one time transaction, do not attempt the transaction again, and if possible do not provide goods or services to the person attempting the transaction. For a recurring or scheduled transaction, it is possible that the card was lost after the last successfully processed payment (or after the authorization for the scheduled payment). In that case, contact your customer for a new credit card number, or ask for a different form of payment. Replace the lost account number on the schedule with the new account number.
