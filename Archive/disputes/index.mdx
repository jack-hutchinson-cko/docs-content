Disputes are a challenging but inevitable part of e-commerce. Disputes occur when a customer claims that a payment is invalid. In this case, the payment is charged back and results in a debit to your account. It's important for you to monitor and respond to these disputes as quickly as possible — thankfully, we've made the workflow simple. 

If you wish to simulate a dispute for testing purposes, you can do so in the sandbox environment. Simply create a payment with one of the test cards and specify the amount \[as documented here\](testing#section-chargebacks).

\### <span class="step\_hl">Step 1:</span> Payment charged back A dispute results in a debit to your account, unless that payment has already been refunded – in which case we resolve it for you. Sometimes, issuers reverse disputes — resulting in a credit to your account. ### <span class="step\_hl">Step 2:</span> Submit evidence If you wish to argue your case, you need to submit evidence to us so that we can pass it on to the card scheme. It's advisable to respond to a dispute as soon as possible. 

A dispute process may go through different statuses from start to finish. For more information on each possible status, see our page on \[chargeback codes\](doc:chargeback-codes). 

\### <span class="step\_hl">Step 3:</span> Await the outcome Finally, you wait up to 45 days for the issuing bank to make a decision. \*\*Outcome A\*\* \* If they accept your evidence, you will be credited back the disputed amount. Congratulations, you've won the dispute! \*\*Outcome B\*\* \* If they reject your evidence, you have lost the dispute. There are no further financial implications. 

There are several reasons a payment might be disputed, the most common being fraudulent charges. The following section outlines all possible dispute reasons, as well as the type of evidence we recommend submitting to make your case. What you provide to us should be the most relevant evidence to the specific case. ## Fraudulent The customer claims they didn't authorize this payment. This can be the result of a lost or stolen card. It is not easy to win this kind of dispute and the evidence listed below is only relevant in specific cases. Sometimes however, buyers forget about purchases they have made. If possible, contact the cardholder and ask them to withdraw their dispute.

\## Unrecognized The customer does not recognize this payment on their bank statement. Similar to fraudulent cases, the evidence below is relevant only for specific cases. Customer communication could be useful. Sometimes buyers forget about purchases they have made or they do not recognize your billing descriptor. If possible, you can contact the customer and ask them to withdraw their dispute.

\## Canceled subscription The customer claims that they have been charged for a canceled subscription. Possibly the merchant forgot about your cancellation policy and expected charges to be terminated. The cancellation policy can be a useful piece of evidence to provide here.

In case you have indeed refunded the customer, make sure to provide that evidence. If your customer was not eligible for a refund you could provide your refund policy as evidence.

\## Incorrect amount The customer claims that they have been charged the wrong amount. Indicating that the correct amount has been charged by providing the receipt or invoice would prove helpful. If available and relevant, customer communication could also be helpful.
