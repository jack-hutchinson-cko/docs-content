The flag status is used to alert you about any suspicious transactions on your account. Whereas not every flagged transaction is fraudulent, flags are used to draw your attention towards the payment for further investigation. The risk settings configured for your business will trigger a flagged transaction. You can set your own \[risk settings\](doc:configuring-risk-settings) in The Hub depending on how vigilant you wish to be. When a transaction is flagged, you must either \[capture\](doc:capture_a_payment) or \[void\](doc:void) it manually. If you take no action, the payment\*\* expires automatically after seven days\*\*, and the funds return to the buyer. ## 10100 response code When using our payments API, a flagged transaction is indicated in the response with \`responseCode: 10100\`. It's important to be aware of this code and what it means. The sample response below shows a flagged transaction indicated by the \[response code\](doc:response-codes) \`10100\`.

\## Flagged transactions in The Hub On The Hub's transactions screen, flagged transactions are identified by an orange status message '<span style="color:#FD7B36">Authorization: Flag</span>' and a \`10100\` response code. This response code indicates that the payment was authorized, but it will not automatically progress to the capture stage — even with auto-capture enabled.
