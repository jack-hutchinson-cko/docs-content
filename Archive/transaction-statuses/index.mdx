Each transaction displayed in The Hub has a distinctive status that is related to the state of the transaction. # Authorisation The cardholder's issuing bank approved a transaction and the transaction amount is held on the customer’s card, but not yet transferred to your account. Authorised transactions must be captured within 7 days. Otherwise, the transaction will be voided automatically and the transaction amount will be released back to the cardholder. 

The card verification statuses in the table below are applicable when processing a \[Zero Dollar Authorisation\](doc:zero-dollar-authorization) payment.

In The Hub, the status section of the Transaction Details screen will display a Chargeback Code, which will indicate the reason for the chargeback.
