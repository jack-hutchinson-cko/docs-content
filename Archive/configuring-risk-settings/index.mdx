The Hub's Risk Settings section provides a wide array of fraud management tools. This module is easily accessible and gives merchants the flexibility to customize their fraud rules within seconds. Merchants can have two different sets of privileges when it comes to updating risk controls: \* Option 1: Activate settings without approval. \* Option 2: Request approval from a Relationship Manager.

Due to the level of complexity involved in risk management, risk control updates need approval by default. Please contact your relationship manager if you would like to circumvent the approval process. Take into consideration that if you are on \*\*Option 1\*\*, changes to your risk controls will affect live processing immediately. Please proceed with caution when saving your updates.

The rules can be configured to trigger the actions listed below. If a transaction triggers more than one risk rule, the action taken will be in line with the following hierarchy:

x

Add Row Add Col

|     |     |
| --- | --- |

|
Decline Blacklist^

|

The transaction is declined by the Payment Gateway, and the attributes of the cardholder are blacklisted.

|
|

Void Blacklist

|

The transaction is voided by the Payment Gateway, and the attributes of the cardholder are blacklisted.

|
|

Decline^

|

Transaction is declined.

|
|

Flag

|

The transaction is authorized but must be captured manually (even if \`autoCapture\` is enabled). <span class="table-info">\[Find out more\](doc:managing-flagged-transactions)</span>

|
|

Void Authorise

|

The transaction is voided by the Payment Gateway.

|
|

Process 3D^

|

3-D Secure authentication is required.

|
|

Process^

|

The transaction is processed normally.

|

\*^Not available for AVS.\* ### Example A transaction triggers the Flag action from an AVS rule and a Decline action from a Velocity rule. Because Decline outranks Flag (see table above), the transaction will be Declined.

Only applicable to US and EU credit cards. AVS rules are only applied to charges that include the cardholder's billing address.

AVS is widely used in the US, Canada, and UK to verify the billing address provided by the cardholder with the address on file at the issuing bank. This section of The Hub allows you to trigger a specific action based on each listed AVS response.

Clicking on the \*\*Request Approval\*\* button will trigger a confirmation pop-up where you would need to verify your password.

Once your AVS risk controls have been updated, you would need to submit a request for approval. Changes to these settings will be reviewed and verified by our relationship management team. This process confirms the validity of your updates and helps ensure that your account is protected from potentially fraudulent activities. These settings will become inactive as illustrated in the screenshot below, which means you will be unable to make additional changes to the risk controls until your request has been reviewed.

The pending approval process applies for each risk section individually. This means you can submit a change for AVS and then proceed to configure the other sections (i.e., Velocity, Mismatch, Threshold, Verified Info).

The approval process can be bypassed by contacting your relationship manager and asking to be granted full permissions to your risk controls. This will switch the Request Approval / Cancel buttons with a Save button as illustrated in the screenshot below:

If full permissions to the risk controls are enabled for your account, please proceed with caution. Changes to your settings will affect live processing immediately after your updates are saved.

Velocity rules allow you to set actions based on the frequency of transactions with matching attributes over a specific period. The page is organized by attribute and includes sections for Card Rules, Email Rules, IP Rules, Bin Rules, Shipping Address Rules, Billing Address Rules, Card Holder Rules, and User Defined Rules. Rules can be established for a range of frequencies, including daily, weekly and monthly.

A customer makes three separate purchases (transactions) on your website in a single day using the same credit card. These three transactions are all processed and approved normally. Later that same day, he initiates his 4th purchase (transaction) using the same credit card. Because the Trigger Count has been set to 3, the rule displayed above will be triggered by the 4th transaction, and the customer will be prompted to complete payment using 3D Secure.

Mismatch rules can be configured to trigger when the details of a transaction do not correspond with one another (e.g. difference in geo-location between the BIN country and the IP address of the cardholder).

Threshold amounts can be set to trigger a defined action based on the value and currency of a transaction. These rules typically allow merchants to manage their exposure to fraud from high-value orders. If the rule is enabled and triggered, the reason code will appear as the transaction response code.

A list of High-Risk Countries can be configured at the business level. This means that if a merchant account has several businesses associated with it, each business can have a different set of High-Risk Countries.
