Information is important to youâ€”we get that. Our reporting APIs are designed to help you quickly find the information you need. _ [Chargeback query](doc:chargeback-query) The chargeback query endpoint allows you to search for a specific chargeback or group of chargebacks based on a number of different filters. _ [Transaction query](doc:transaction-query) The transactions reporting endpoint allows you to search for a specific transaction or group of transactions. \* [Reconciliation API (Beta)](doc:reconciliation-api) The reconciliation API allows you to view a lot more information about the reconciliation of all transactions, such as payouts and payments.
