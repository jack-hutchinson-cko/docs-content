Information is important to youâ€”we get that. Our reporting APIs are designed to help you quickly find the information you need. \* \[Chargeback query\](doc:chargeback-query) The chargeback query endpoint allows you to search for a specific chargeback or group of chargebacks based on a number of different filters. \* \[Transaction query\](doc:transaction-query) The transactions reporting endpoint allows you to search for a specific transaction or group of transactions. \* \[Reconciliation API (Beta)\](doc:reconciliation-api) The reconciliation API allows you to view a lot more information about the reconciliation of all transactions, such as payouts and payments.
