\*Everything you need to know about integrating Checkout.com into your Drupal store. Make sure you already have a Drupal store installation, and, of course, an account with us.\* 

\- \[x\] Drupal Version: 7.x - \[x\] Commerce Version: 7.x 

1\. Download the plugin from \[GitHub\](https://github.com/CKOTech/checkout-drupalcommerce-plugin). 2. \*\*Install the plugin:\*\* to do this, clone the extension and copy its contents to \`\[drupal directory\]\\sites\\all\\modules\\\`. 

1\. Visit your Drupal admin interface and navigate to \`Modules > Commerce (contrib)\`. 2. Click to enable \*\*Checkout.com GW3\*\*. 

\#### Before you start 1. To configure the payment settings, enter your Drupal admin and navigate to \`Store > Configuration > Payment Methods\`.</li> 2. Find the section \*\*Enabled payment method rules\*\*, and click \*\*enable\*\* to enable the rules. To find the configuration form and start making changes: a. Click \*\*edit\*\*, b. on the resulting page, find the section \*\*Enable payment method: Credit / Debit cards (Checkout.com)\*\*, and click \*\*edit\*\* again. This then opens the \*\*Payment Settings\*\* form. #### The payment settings form 1. \*\*Enter your keys\*\*. In the related fields, enter your \*\*Private API Key\*\* and your \*\*Public API Key\*\*. 

your Checkout.com account manager can provide these to you. 

2\. \*\*Select a transaction method\*\*. \*Decide which option is best for your business.\* - \*\*Authorize Only \*\* Transactions will only authorize and must be captured manually. - \*\*Authorize and Capture\*\* Transactions are authorized and captured automatically. \*With authorize and capture, an auto-capture time can be set. Auto-capture time defines how long after an authorization that a capture will be made — the default time is 0.\* 3. \*\*Choose which card types to display\*\*. \* If you're a PCI Compliant merchant, select the card types you want to display on the front end. \* Select method type: a. \*\*Yes\*\* for fully PCI Compliant merchants b. \*\*No\*\* to enable Checkout.js. 

In this case, like the majority of our merchants, you are probably not fully PCI compliant and should choose \*\*No\*\* to enable Checkout.js. 

Checkout.js makes payments on Drupal simple. Once you've installed the plugin and configured your settings, you're good to go. From now on, when your customers check out and click '\*\*Continue to next step\*\*', the iFrame payment form pops up, like so:

If payment is successful, your customers are redirected to the designated success URL — where a success message is displayed. In your Drupal Commerce admin interface, the status of a payment will change to \*\*Pending\*\*, after a successful authorization; and finally \*\*Captured\*\*, after an automatic or manual capture.
