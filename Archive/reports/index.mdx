The report is comprised of the following: _ **Multiple Attributes**: Cardholders using multiple credit cards or emails, addresses, credit cards associated with multiple users _ **Country Mismatch**: Transactions where BIN country and Billing address of the cardholder do not match _ **Lost/Stolen/Pickup**: Transactions approved that have an attribute associated with a previously declined transaction for reason 'Lost', 'Stolen' or 'Pick up' _ **AVS = N**: Transactions where the AVS response is 'N', meaning there was no match _ **BIN Attack**: Excessive number of transactions from a specific BIN, which can be a sign of a fraud attack _ **High Value Orders**: Transactions which greatly exceed the average ticket value of the merchant \* ** Volume Spike**: Transactions resulting in an unexpected spike in volume which might signal fraud activity
