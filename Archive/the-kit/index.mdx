By using The Kit, developers have complete control over the user-flow when accepting payments. Payments are processed using a card token, where the merchant will capture and send credit card details to Checkout.com's API server using a [The Kit](doc:the-kit#section-card-payment-form) .

Using The Kit requires stringent PCI compliance; if you're unsure whether it's for you, then speak to a member of our [integration team](mailto:support@checkout.com). We advise you to check out our more straightforward [integration options](doc:integration-options) first.

**The Kit** enables you to monitor a payment form `<form>` and control the process of tokenizing card details and submitting only the card token back to your server. By configuring the `<form>` with `data-checkout` attributes and a valid submit button, The Kit will automatically send the correct card data to Checkout.com's API servers and obtain a card token. If the card tokenization or card payment process is successful, the `<form>` is submitted to the success URL defined in [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/). Take a look at the payment form example below:

HTML

<form class="card-form" method="POST" action="/cards/charge">

 <input data-checkout="card-number" type="text" placeholder="Credit card number">

 <input data-checkout="card-name" type="text" placeholder="Name on card">

 <input data-checkout="expiry-month" type="text" placeholder="MM">

 <input data-checkout="expiry-year" type="text" placeholder="YY">

 <input data-checkout="cvv" type="text" placeholder="CVV">

 <input type="submit" value="Pay Now">

</form>

Do not give name attributes to the `<input>` boxes as this will prevent the card details submitting to your server.
