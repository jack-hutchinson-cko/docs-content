If you're processing payments, transmitting and storing card data, you must comply with the \[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards\](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security\_standards) (PCI DSS). \*Checkout Technology Ltd, a company within the Checkout.com group, is certified for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI â€“ DSS) as a Level 1 Service Provider.\* It's important to note that PCI compliance is a responsibility shared between both Checkout.com and your business. When accepting payments, it is essential that you do so in a PCI compliant manner. The complexity of this depends upon your integration methods. However, the simplest way to remain PCI compliant is never to see or access your customers' card data. To make this easy for you, we have some great integration advice: \* Use one of our methods of integration that enable you to accept payments without ever handling card data: \[Frames\](doc:frames) and \[Checkout.js\](doc:checkoutjs). \* Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all payment pages, so that they use HTTPS. \* Review and validate your PCI compliance once a year. 

It is a requirement that all Checkout.com merchants validate their PCI compliance annually. Most of our customers can do this with a \[Self-Assessment Questionnaire\](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document\_library?category=saqs#results) (SAQ) which is provided by the \[PCI Security Standards Council\](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). The PCI requirements for our integration methods are as follows: \* Checkout.js and Frames: \*\*\*Pre-filled SAQ A\*\*\* \* Mobile SDK: \*\*\*Pre-filled SAQ A\*\*\* \* The Kit: \*\*\*SAQ A-EP\*\*\* \* Full card details: \*\*\*SAQ D\*\*\* 

Please contact your relationship manager if you have any questions or are unsure about PCI compliance.
