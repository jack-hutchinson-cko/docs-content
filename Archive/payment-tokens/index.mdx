A payment token can only be created using a secret key. It is a snapshot of payment information that securely isolates the transaction value and currency of a payment. Payment tokens expire after 15 minutes. If a payment is not completed in that time, its Payment Token will no longer be available to use. We advise adding optional custom metadata (e.g. order number) to a payment token, which can be later used to verify the authenticity of a transaction further.
