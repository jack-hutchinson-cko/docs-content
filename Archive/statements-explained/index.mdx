It's essential you and your team understand your statements. We've worked hard to design our statements to not only display the information you need but make them understandable and convenient to work with. **Here's what you need to know:** _ Your business activity is summarized by processed amounts, refunds, chargebacks, fees, and rolling reserves—these are explained in further detail below. _ Times and dates are based on Coordinated Universal Time and will define the period of transactions these statements cover.

## The header The header appears on the top part of each page of every statement. The example below is from page one; however, subsequent pages follow a similar, slightly lighter, format.
