Learn to process a payment using an iDEAL alternative payment method. With Checkout.com, you can accept direct API-to-API payments using our alternative payment methods. This guide outlines the workflow for processing alternative payments with iDEAL.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 1:</span> **Create a payment token** First, you need to create a payment token. A payment token is a snapshot of the transaction information — it is uneditable at the browser end. Payment tokens expire after 15-minutes — so, be quick. To learn more about payment tokens, visit [payment tokens](doc:payment-tokens). An example payment token request and response is listed below.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 4:</span> **Handle the alternative payment response** A successful response to an alternative payment charge request includes a `responseCode` of 10000, as well as a `paymentUrl`. You will need to redirect to the `paymentUrl` to allow the customer to complete the alternative payment.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 5:</span> ** Customer completes alternative payment page** A successful response to an alternative payment request will include a `responseCode` of 10000 and a `paymentUrl`. It is necessary to redirect the customer to the `paymentUrl` to allow them to complete the alternative payment. Once the customer is redirected to the `paymentUrl`, they are prompted to complete the alternative payment flow to finalize the transaction.

If the customer closes, abandons or otherwise does not complete the alternative payment page flow, the charge will be canceled.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 6:</span> ** Checkout.com redirects to merchant's 'payment successful' page** If the alternative payment is successful, the customer is redirected to the merchant's 'Payment Successful' page.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 7:</span> **Verify the alternative payment charge** At your server end, grab the payment token using the form variable `cko-payment-token` and use it to [verify the alternative payment](doc:verify-an-alternative-payment). ## <span class="step\_hl">Step 8:</span> **Confirm the payment with webhooks**

Webhooks are the only way to confirm the successful completion of an alternative payment transaction.

Checkout's merchant API uses webhooks to push information to a merchant's destination URL whenever there is a charge transaction. All the notifications are delivered via an **[HTTP POST](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)>)** request in **[JSON](https://www.json.org/)** or **[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)** format. Receiving a charge.captured notification via Webhooks is the only way to confirm whether an Alternative Payment charge has been completed successfully. All orders should be marked as pending until you receive a successful Webhook response (response code 10000). Only then should a transaction be marked as completed. Find out more about [webhooks](ref:webhooks-1).
