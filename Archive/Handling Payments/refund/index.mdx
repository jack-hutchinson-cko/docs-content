_Use a refund to return a payment to a customer; either partially or in full._ There are two types of refunds you might need to process: _ **Full refund** A full refund returns the total amount of the transaction to the customer — it can only be performed once. _ **Partial refund** A partial refund returns a sum less than the captured amount. A payment can be refunded multiple times, but cannot exceed the original payment amount.

Refunds can be made in [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/) or by using this [API endpoint :fa-code:](doc:refund#section-the-request). Once processed, it is **not possible** to cancel a refund. To process a refund successfully, the merchant must send the payment ID of the captured transaction in the API. You can find the transaction' ID: _ In the response to the Payment request _ By querying the payment history \* From the Webhook notification For both full and partial refunds, the requests are the same. Any refunds for less than the original captured amount will be considered partial refunds.

For payments with an automatic capture, the payment response will contain the ID of the authorization. This ID cannot be used for refunds.

## The request Refund requests are created using a POST request. Use the details below to set up your request. ### Endpoint live <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="post-tag">POST</span>https://api2.checkout.com/v2/charges/{chargeId}/refund</p></pre> ### Endpoint sandbox <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="post-tag">POST</span>https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/v2/charges/{chargeId}/refund</p></pre> ### Header and path parameters

### Troubleshooting Let's take a look at what might have happened — this checklist might help to identify the problem: _ Is the refund amount higher than the original payment? _ Has the payment already been refunded? \* Did you send the Auth ID instead of the Payment ID?
