Checkout.com's two-step **authorization and capture** process enables a merchant to capture payments either automatically or manually. When a payment is authorized, the funds are held on the customer's card for seven days. With auto-capture disabled, a merchant can either capture a payment directly from [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/) or by using this API. The transaction is **canceled** if the merchant doesn't capture the authorization within seven days. Authorized payments can be captured either in **full** or **partially**.

You can cancel an authorized payment at any time by voiding it. However, captured payments can only be [refunded](doc:refund).

Our manual capture API can be used on your server-side code to capture a payment. This endpoint manually captures an authorized card payment either in full or partially. Any capture amount less than the original transaction will be treated as a partial capture. If a payment is created with autoCapture set to 'n', you must either use this endpoint to capture the payment or capture it from [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/). Manual capture is not allowed if `autoCapture` is set to `y`. ## The request Capture a payment by sending a **POST** API request to the URI below. In the URI, replace **{chargeId}** with the `chargeId` of the **authorized transaction**, however, first **add the prefix** `charge\_` or `charge_test\_` to your ID. ### Endpoint live <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="post-tag">POST</span>https://api2.checkout.com/v2/charges/charge\_{chargeId}/capture</p></pre> ### Endpoint sandbox <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="post-tag">POST</span>https://sandbox.checkout.com/api2/v2/charges/charge\_{chargeId}/capture</p></pre> ### Header and path parameters

Checkout.com’s payment object contains two fields for configuring authorize and capture settings. **autoCapture** _ Set to `y` to authorize a payment and automatically capture it after a specified time period. _ Set to `n` to authorize a payment and manually capture it using our [Capture a payment API](doc:capture_a_payment) or [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/). **autoCapTime** \* If `autoCapture = y`, `autoCapTime` will define the number of hours (0-168) between the payment authorization and automatic capture. Set to `autoCapTime` ='0' to authorize and capture a payment at the same time.
