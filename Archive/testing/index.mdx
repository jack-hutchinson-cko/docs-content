\--- # Response codes Create a payment with the values in the table below to simulate and trigger the listed response codes. To use them, just change the value (amount) of your test transaction. If you use any other \`value\`, your payment will return as approved (response code \`10000\`).

If a value contains an \`x\`, you can replace it with any number of your choosing, for example, \`xxx05\` could be used as \`12305\`.
