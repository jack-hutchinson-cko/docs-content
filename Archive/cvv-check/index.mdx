\*The CVV number ("card verification value") appears on credit card and debit cards. It is a three-digit number on Visa, MasterCard and Discover branded cards and a four-digit number on American Express cards. Running a CVV check adds an additional layer of fraud protection to your transactions. \* As standard, Checkout.comâ€™s payment gateway requires merchants to include the payment card's CVV when sending a payment with either full card details or a card token. The CVV is not required when sending a payment with card ID or a default card, but you still have the option of adding the CVV if you wish. However, when you include the CVV in a request, it is subject to verification, if it does not match, the request will fail.

No problem! Your account manager can arrange this for you.

There are two possible configurations for using the CVV check in your transactions: \[CVV required\](doc:cvv-check#section-cvv-required) and \[CVV optional\](doc:cvv-check#section-cvv-optional). ## CVV required If the CVV is required, you must include it for all payment request types except for payments using a card ID. If the payment contains incorrect or missing CVV information, the request will fail.

You are required to include the CVV. \*If you don't include these, you will receive an 'invalid CVV' response. \*

\## CVV optional For CVV optional, you can send any type of payment request with or without the CVV. However, if you include the CVV in a payment request, it will be subject to verification. If it is incorrect, the charge will not be successful.

You are not required to include the CVV. \*If you \*\*do\*\* include it, it will be subject to verification checks.\*
