_Checkout.com's payment gateway determines the charge amount by assessing the value and the currency contained in the charge request._ The value field in a charge request must be a non-zero positive integer — no decimals. Depending on the currency of the payment, there are three options for calculating the value amount: <span class="method\_hl">Option 1:</span> [**The full value**](doc:calculating-the-value#section-full-value) <span class="method\_hl">Option 2:</span> [**The value divided by 1000**](doc:calculating-the-value#section-value-divided-by-1000) <span class="method\_hl">Option 3:</span> [**The value divided by 100**](doc:calculating-the-value#section-value-divided-by-100)

The amount field accepts a minimum of one and a maximum of nine digits; this is true for all currencies.

---

## <span class="method\_hl">Option 1:</span> The full value For the following currencies, the value is the same as the full charge amount; for example, `value=100` is equal to 100 Japanese Yen.
