Every merchant who sells products or services online is exposed to different types of risk when it comes to payment processing. Our risk management tools help mitigate potentially fraudulent charges by allowing merchants to configure automated responses to various transaction scenarios. The Hub’s flexible and highly tailored risk settings provide a wide array of risk management tools that take away the hassle of managing risk.

The Blacklist Management section allows you to blacklist various types of attributes, which are configured at the account level. These include customer email, email domain, card number, BIN number, Phone number, and IP Address. Please refer to the [Blacklist management](doc:blacklist-management) guide.

The Hub’s risk section allows you to configure a set of fraud management settings, which include Address Verification Service (AVS), Velocity, Mismatch, Threshold, and Verified Info Rules. Please refer to the [Configuring risk settings](doc:configuring-risk-settings) guide.

Risk settings can be configured to trigger a flagged transaction rule, which would then require a review. A flagged transaction can either be Captured or Voided. If no action is taken within seven days, the transaction will expire automatically. Please refer to the [Managing flagged transactions](doc:managing-flagged-transactions) guide.
