\*Frames is quick and easy to integrate, accepts online payments from all major credit cards, and is customizable to your brand. \* Embed the Frames payment form to your website and allow your customers to enter their payment details directly on your checkout page. From Frames, your customers' sensitive information is processed by us and exchanged for a token. This process is called <<glossary:tokenization>>. After you have a card token, you're able to \[create a payment\](doc:payments-quickstart), add a customer, or save the card for later.

The Frames solution requires a little bit of customization and integration know-how. If you would like a simpler solution, then take a look at \[Checkout.js\](doc:checkoutjs).

After a simple background color tweak, this is what Frames looks like:

**URL to Embed:**

\*Try it out!\* \* use one of our \[test cards\](doc:testing#section-test-card-numbers), for example, :fa-cc-visa: <span class="card-number">4242 4242 4242 4242</span> \* use any future expiry date (mm/yy) \* and the CVV is :fa-lock: \*\*100\*\*

Sure, Frames looks great! But, it also has lots of payment options:

- **Image Sizing:**
- Smart Fit
- 100% Width
- 80% Width
- Original Size

- **Options:**
- Image Border

It doesn't take long to get started with Frames. That's why we like to describe the process in just two-steps. ### <span class="step\_hl">Step 1:</span> Embed the code Pick a method for integrating — there's a couple of different ways you can do it —, then add the code to your page. You'll need to make a few edits here, and change the \`publicKey\` to your own. To help, we have added some comments to the code to guide you.

\### <span class="step\_hl">Step 2:</span> Customize We built Frames for customization, as such you have a lot of control over the appearance of your form. In our \[example\](doc:frames#section-frames-demo) above, we changed the background color; with some simple tweaks, you can do that and a lot more. Check out our customization page for details about making Frames your own.
