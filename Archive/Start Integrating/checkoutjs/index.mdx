\*A simple way to integrate Checkout.com's full suite of payment options into your website.\* Checkout.js is one of the quickest ways to get started accepting payments. It's a widget that sits on your website and provides all the tools for collecting a customer's card details and sending them straight to us for <<glossary:tokenization>> — \*it's super safe, they never even touch your server\*. Subsequently, a card token is returned to you, enabling you to \[create a payment\](doc:authorize-a-payment) request. Take a look at the default Checkout.js payment widget below! If it's a bit cumbersome for you, try using a \[custom button\](doc:integrate-checkoutjs#section-example-b-use-a-custom-pay-now-button) instead.

Checkout.js is a quick and simple approach. If you'd prefer your own customizable payment form, then take a look at \[Frames\](doc:frames).

\*\*Why not give Checkout.js a test run?\*\* Click the \*\*Pay Now\*\* button below, and you'll see the form spring to life. Use the following details to fill in the form: \* email address — we have completed this for you \* use one of our \[test cards\](doc:testing#section-test-card-numbers), for example, :fa-cc-visa: <span class="card-number">4242 4242 4242 4242</span> \* use any future expiry date (mm/yy) \* and the CVV is :fa-lock: \*\*100\*\* \*Don't worry. It's just a test, we won't charge anyone's card.\*

Checkout.js doesn't process a payment automatically, but it provides the first steps for obtaining a card token. To finish the payment process, you need some server-side code included on your page.

Try our 2-step process to get started with Checkout.js. Then, when you're ready, have a go customizing it to your brand. ### <span class="step\_hl">Step 1:</span> Pick a display method The first step to using Checkout.js is to pick a display method. Your requirements and technical know-how will significantly influence this decision. Our recommended and the most straightforward option is \*window.CKOConfig\*, but take a look at our \[integration options\](doc:integrate-checkoutjs) and decide which solution is best for you. ### <span class="step\_hl">Step 2:</span> Add the code To add Checkout.js, insert a supplied snippet of code to your page, and then change the action attribute to submit the form to your server-side code. Below is an example for \*window.CKOConfig\*, your integration method may be different, but the core process is the same.

Import from Gist

In the code, you must replace the example’s \`publicKey\` with your own. You can find this in \[The Hub\](https://hub.checkout.com). The \`publicKey\` enables us to identify you and allows you to test integration using your Hub account. At this point, you're ready to collect some tokens. Have a go \[authorizing a payment\](doc:authorize-a-payment) or \[verifying a card\](doc:zero-dollar-authorization). 

The \*next step\*, is to customize the appearance to match your brand. Luckily, Checkout.js gives you the flexibility to adjust its look and feel to your page. Learn how to \[configure the Checkout.js Payment Widget and Payment Lightbox\](doc:customize-your-checkoutjs).
