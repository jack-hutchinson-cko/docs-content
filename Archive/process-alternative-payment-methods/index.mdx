\*Learn to process a payment using one of our alternative payment methods.\* With Checkout.com, you can accept direct API-to-API payments using our alternative payment methods. The great news is, many\* of our alternative payment methods use a very similar workflow. \*This guide outlines the workflow for processing alternative payments with Alipay, PayPal, Sofort, and TenPay. For iDEAL payments, see \[Using iDEAL alternative payments\](doc:using-ideal-alternative-payments). 

\## <span class="step\_hl">Step 1:</span> \*\*Create a payment token\*\* First, you need to create a payment token. A payment token is a snapshot of the transaction information — it is uneditable at the browser end. Payment tokens expire after 15-minutes — so, be quick. To learn more about payment tokens, visit \[Payment tokens\](doc:payment-tokens). An example payment token request and response is listed below.

If creating a token for use with PayPal, you will need to add the mandatory \`trackId\` field to the body of your request. \[Find out more\](doc:authorize-a-paypal-payment). 

\## <span class="step\_hl">Step 2:</span>\*\* Process an alternative payment\*\* The following endpoint creates an alternative payment request. Use the \`paymentProviderId\` (Local Payment Provider ID) to specify which alternative payment method you are using. For example, \`lpp\_14\` will process a payment with Sofort. The local payment provider codes, supported by this particular flow, are as follows: 

 x     

Add Row Add Col

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Alipay 

 | 

\`lpp\_12\` 

 |
| 

iDEAL <span class="table-info">The iDEAL payment flow is slightly different. \[Find out more here\](doc:using-ideal-alternative-payments).</span> 

 | 

\`lpp\_9\` 

 |
| 

PayPal 

 | 

\`lpp\_19\` 

 |
| 

Sofort 

 | 

\`lpp\_14\` 

 |
| 

TenPay 

 | 

\`lpp\_11\` 

 |

The code snippet below is an example of an alternative payment request using Sofort's local payment provider ID, \`lpp\_14\`. To customize this for your request, just replace \`lpp\_14\` with the local payment provider ID of your desired alternative payment method.

\## <span class="step\_hl">Step 6:</span> \*\*Verify the alternative payment charge\*\* At your server end, grab the payment token using the form variable \`cko-payment-token\` and use it to \[verify the alternative payment\](doc:verify-an-alternative-payment). ## <span class="step\_hl">Step 7:</span> \*\*Confirm the payment with webhooks\*\* 

Webhooks are the only way to confirm the successful completion of an alternative payment transaction. 

Checkout's merchant API uses webhooks to push information to a merchant's destination URL whenever there is a charge transaction. All the notifications are delivered via an \*\*\[HTTP POST\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST\_(HTTP))\*\* request in \*\*\[JSON\](https://www.json.org/)\*\* or \*\*\[XML\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)\*\* format. Receiving a charge.captured notification via Webhooks is the only way to confirm whether an Alternative Payment charge has been completed successfully. All orders should be marked as pending until you receive a successful Webhook response (response code 10000). Only then should a transaction be marked as completed. Find out more about \[webhooks\](ref:webhooks-1).
