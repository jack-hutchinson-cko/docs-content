_Our reconciliation API allows you to view core information about your transactions, such as **payouts** and **payments**._ With the reconciliation API, you can quickly find all fees associated with each of your transactions. In short, we're enabling you to concentrate on the important stuff while completely streamlining your financial reporting. ### **Two endpoints for very different needs** We've developed two endpoints for the purpose of reconciliation, giving you the freedom to access your transaction information. Each API has been meticulously designed and built with you in mind. Let's take a look at what they do: **[Statements and payouts summary](doc:reconciliation-api#section-1-statements-and-payouts-summary) ** The statement and payouts summary reveals all the statements and payouts that have occurred within a set timeframe. **[Transactions summary ](reconciliation-api#section-2-transactions-summary)** The transactions summary displays all transactions and fees that have taken place within a defined time period. This report includes all associated statement and payments IDs—making searching and referencing easy.

Use this API to view the information for all your statements and payouts within a time-frame chosen by you. ### Request your statements and payouts summary Requests are made using a GET read request. To correctly compose your request, you will need the following three components: _ **secret key** — find yours in [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/) _ **start-date** (ISO format) \* **end-date** (ISO format)

It's possible to skip and limit your reports. Learn more about this [later](doc:reconciliation-api#section-skip-and-limit-results).

## The request Use the details below to set up your request. To set the timeframe of your request, replace `{start-date}` and `{end-date}` with your desired start and end dates in UTC format. ### Endpoint <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="get-tag">GET</span>https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/statements?from={start-date}&to={end-date}</p></pre> ### Header parameters

## Payment breakdown You can break down the detail even further by using the `payout_breakdown` field. This will provide all totals from each section of the statement. Set up your request as above, then simply add `&include=payout_breakdown` at the end of the URL. For example: `https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/statements?from=2018-09-01&to=2018-09-19&include=payout\_breakdown` If your request is successful, the response should look something like this:

Received an error? Don’t worry! First, check your original request and try again. If you're still having problems, ask our support team for help. ### Understanding your statements and payouts summary The response is designed to present your information as clearly as possible. That’s why your statements and payouts summary consists of just two simple sections: <span class="number\_hl">1.</span> **Statements** Listed in chronological order, this is a record of all your statements within the selected time-frame. The table below outlines the information included and its meaning.

Add Row Add Col

|
`id`

|

|
|

`date`

|

Date the statement was generated.

|
|

`payouts`

|

The summary is a breakdown of your statement, ordered by the payout currency and its associated payout ID.

|

<span class="number\_hl">2.</span> **Payouts** Grouped by payout currency, this section
details all payouts to your bank account within the chosen date range. The table
below describes this data and its purpose.= x

| --- | --- |

|
`currency`

|

The currency of the payout.

|
|

|

The total fee charged for the payout.

You can work out your net amount by calculating the sum of the carried forward amount, current period amount, and payout fee.

## Skip and limit results Reports are rather large, as such, there are occasions when we need to filter our results. Let's go through the process together. The table below shows all the filterable parameters and their descriptions.

Add Row Add Col

|     |     |
| --- | --- |

|
`skip`

|

This is an example URI for a statements and payouts summary: `https://api.checkout.com/reconcilliation/statements?from=2017-09-01&to=2017-09-07` The above URI allows you to view all your transactions, but let's try limiting the results. Here is the standard URL format: `https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/statements?from={start-date}&to={end-date}&{filter-parameter}={filter-parameter-type}` Fill in the `{start-date}`, `{end-date}`, `{filter-parameter}` (`limit`) and `{filter-parameter-type}`—in this instance, we will request (limit) twenty results. Your filterable URI should now look like this: `https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/statements?from=2017-11-01&to=2017-11-07&limit=20`

Use this API to view all the transactions that have taken place within a timeframe chosen by you. This report includes all associated statement and payment IDs—it makes searching and referencing easy.

The transaction API has been designed purely for reconciliation purposes. As a result, it only provides transactions with a corresponding statement ID.

### Request your transactions summary Requests are made using a GET read request. To correctly compose your request, you will need the following three components: _ **secret key** — find yours in [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/login) _ **start-date** (ISO format) * **end-date** (ISO format) *Please note: no transactions before August 1, 2017 will appear using this API.\*

It's possible to filter your transactions. Reports are filterable by payout currency, statement ID, payout ID, and transaction ID. You can also skip and limit results — but, [more on this later](doc:reconciliation-api#section-skip-and-limit-results).

## The request Use the details below to set up your request. To set time span of your request, replace `{start-date}` and `{end-date}` with your desired start and end dates in UTC format. ### Endpoint <pre class="api-header-long-url"><p class="api-header"><span class="get-tag">GET</span>https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/transactions?from={start-date}&to={end-date}</p></pre> ### Header parameters

## Understanding your transactions summary The summary is designed to present your information as clearly as possible. The response to this is likely to be large —that's good! You’ve been processing a lot of payments— but, if we break it down, it’s simple to understand. Three sections represent the transactions summary: <span class="number\_hl">1:</span> **Transactions** This section displays all transaction information between the selected time-frame.

This is an example URI for a transaction summary: `https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/transactions?from=2017-09-01&to=2017-09-07` The above URI allows you to view all your transactions, but now try filtering them by the payout currency (payout_currency). Here is the standard URL format: `https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/transactions?from={start-date}&to={end-date}&{filter-parameter}={filter-parameter-type}` Fill in the `start-date`, `end-date`, `filter-parameter` (`payout_currency`) and `filter-parameter-type`—in this instance, we will use British Pounds (`GBP`). Your filterable URI should now look like this: `https://api.checkout.com/reconciliation/transactions?from=2017-11-01&to=2017-11-07&payout\_currency=GBP`
