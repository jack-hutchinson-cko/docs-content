_In the event that a 3D Secure charge cannot be completed, attemptN3D downgrades the charge to Non-3-D Secure. By doing this, all payment details are preserved and we'll re-submit the request so you don't lose the transaction._ The `attemptN3D` feature is currently supported by all payment flows except for _recurring payments_. ## AttemptN3D parameter

`attemptN3D` <span class="field-type">Boolean</span> <span class="optional-def">Optional</span>

|

Downgrades a payment to Non-3D Secure under specific circumstances. <span class="table-info">attemptN3D must be set to true in the request to enable Non-3D secure charges.</span>

|

Once `attemptN3D` is enabled, our hybrid solution will handle the downgrade to non-3D Secure processing in the following cases: 1. The card used is not 3D Secure enabled or enrolled by the issuing bank. 2. Any system malfunctions (i.e. the issuing bank’s 3D Secure system is down).

The liability shift advantage of 3D Secure payments will not apply to downgraded (non-3D payments). This means that there will be no protection against potentially fraudulent transactions or chargebacks.

If `attemptN3D` is set to `false` (it's default setting), transactions that cannot be completed as 3D Secure will fail and one of the below response codes will be returned: [20153](doc:response-codes): 3D Secure system malfunction [20150](doc:response-codes): Card not 3-DS enabled Downgrading to Non-3-D Secure charges will be ignored in any of the following scenarios: 1. `attemptN3D` is omitted from the payment request body or is set to false. 2. The charge mode is not 3D-Secure. 3. The risk engine requires 3DS. The merchant can specify the success and fail redirect URLs using the parameters `successUrl` and `failUrl` in the payload request. If the parameters are not defined, the redirect URLs fallback to those set in the channel's [business level administration](doc:business-level-administration) in [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com).
