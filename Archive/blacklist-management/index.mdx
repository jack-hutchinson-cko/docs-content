The Blacklist Attributes module provides a centralized blacklist management section, which can be found under the Risk tab of The Hub. This section is separate from the blacklist attributes found within the Blacklist Transaction screen, providing a better experience and improved control. Merchants now can blacklist attributes even if there are no transactions present in the system. 

Blacklisted attributes are configured at the account level. This means that if an attribute is blacklisted, all corresponding businesses that are processing charges will be affected.
