The **Private Shared Key** is a header that The Hub sends to your page with every transaction. It is not required, but where possible should be specified. The Private Shared Key is used to check the authenticity of notification WebHooks coming from Checkout.com. 5. **Save your settings** Once the account keys have been added, ensure that you save your changes using the **Save Config** button. **That's it!** You're all set to start taking payments.
