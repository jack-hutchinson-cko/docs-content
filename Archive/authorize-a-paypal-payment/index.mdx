_Learn to authorize a payment using PayPal._ With Checkout.com, you can accept direct API-to-API payments using our alternative payment methods. The great news is, many\* of our alternative payment methods use a very similar workflow.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 1:</span> **Create a payment token** First, you need to create a payment token for PayPal. A payment token is a snapshot of the transaction information — it is uneditable at the browser end. Payment tokens expire after 15-minutes — so, be quick. The `trackId` parameter is required when creating a payment token to be used with PayPal and should be unique for each request. Also, set auto capture to `n` (no) to capture authorised charges manually. An example PayPal payment token request and response is listed below.

Request Response

{
"autoCapture": "n",
"value": 100,
"currency": "EUR",
"chargeMode": "3",
"metadata": {
"paypal_logoUrl": "https://merchant.com/your-logo.jpg",
"paypal_stc_test1": "value1",
"paypal_stc_test2": "value2"
},
"trackId": "PayPalPayment123",
"udf1": "test data 1",
"udf2": "test data 2",
"udf3": "test data 3",
"udf4": "test data 4",
"udf5": "test data 5",
"successUrl": "http://mycustomerurl.com/order?result=pass",
"failUrl": "http://mycustomerurl.com/order?result=fail"
}

}

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 2:</span>** Authorize a PayPal payment** The following endpoint authorizes a PayPal payment.

JSON

{
"email" : "test@email.com",
"localPayment" : {
"lppId" : "lpp_19",
"userData" : {}
},
"paymentToken" : "pay_tok_76918102-264F-40DF-A6D4-987BAE5939B3"

}

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 3:</span> **Handle PayPal's response** A successful response for a PayPal payment request includes a `responseCode` of **10000**, as well as a `paymentUrl`. You will need to redirect to the `paymentUrl` to allow the customer to complete the alternative payment.

JSON

{
"id": "pay_tok_76918102-264f-40df-a6d4-987bae5939b3",
"liveMode": true,
"responseCode": "10000",
"chargeMode": 3,
"localPayment": {
"paymentUrl": "https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/checkoutnow?token=EC-PayPalPaymentToken&useraction=commit"
}
}

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 4:</span> ** Customer completes alternative payment page** A successful response to an alternative payment request will include a `responseCode` of 10000 and a `paymentUrl`. It is necessary to redirect the customer to the `paymentUrl` to allow them to complete the alternative payment. Once the customer is redirected to the `paymentUrl`, they are prompted to complete the alternative payment flow to finalize the transaction.

If the customer closes, abandons or otherwise does not complete the PayPal payment page, the payment automatically cancels.

## <span class="step\_hl">Step 5:</span> ** Checkout.com redirects to merchant's 'payment successful' page** If the PayPal payment is successful, the customer is redirected to the merchant's 'Payment Successful' page. ## <span class="step\_hl">Step 6:</span> **Verify the PayPal payment** At your server end, grab the payment token using the form variable `cko-payment-token` and use it to [verify the alternative payment](doc:verify-an-alternative-payment). ## <span class="step\_hl">Step 7:</span> **Confirm the payment with webhooks**

Webhooks are the only way to confirm the successful completion of an alternative payment transaction.

Checkout's merchant API uses webhooks to push information to a merchant's destination URL whenever there is a charge transaction. All the notifications are delivered via an **[HTTP POST](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)>)** request in **[JSON](https://www.json.org/)** or **[XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)** format. Receiving a `charge.captured` notification via Webhooks is the only way to confirm whether an Alternative Payment charge has been completed successfully. All orders should be marked as pending until you receive a successful Webhook response (response code `10000`). Only then should a transaction be marked as completed. Find out more about [webhooks](ref:webhooks-1).
