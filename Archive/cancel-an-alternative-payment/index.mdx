If the customer does not complete the payment page, the payment will remain pending. Payments are deferred and not captured instantly; this means the payment could stay in deferred capture for several days until the status automatically updates to _canceled_. ## Webhook notification Once the charge is _canceled_, Checkout.com will send a `charge.voided` webhook.
