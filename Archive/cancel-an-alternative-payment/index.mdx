If the customer does not complete the payment page, the payment will remain pending. Payments are deferred and not captured instantly; this means the payment could stay in deferred capture for several days until the status automatically updates to \*canceled\*. ## Webhook notification Once the charge is \*canceled\*, Checkout.com will send a \`charge.voided\` webhook.
