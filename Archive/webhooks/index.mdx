_A webhook (also known as a web callback) is an automated notification triggered by a specific event._ Checkout.com has configured webhook notifications to trigger every time the status of a payment is updated. These webhooks are sent to a designated destination URL. Webhooks provide definitive confirmation of a status update and are used for a variety of purposes, such as fulfilling orders, sending automated status updates to customers, or even integrating with third-party application services.

You can set up your webhook destination URL in the System Administration section of The Hub.

In the diagram below, a merchant using [Checkout.js](doc:checkoutjs) has configured a [charge.captured](doc:chargecaptured) webhook to trigger a notification to the merchant's server confirming the payment.

It is highly recommended that you use charge.captured as the Webhook trigger since this is the final state of a processed charge.

Checkout.com sends webhooks via an HTTP POST request in JSON or XML format. Each webhook contains an `eventType` and a **message**.

If `autoCapture` is enabled, the response is always returned in JSON regardless of the request format. Therefore, even if the request is sent in XML, expect the response to be in JSON.

Receiving a charge.captured notification via webhooks is the only way to confirm a payment completes successfully.

If a merchant account is configured to receive webhook notifications, callbacks will be sent from one of the following IP Addresses:

When a webhook notification fails, retries are attempted up to a maximum of seven times. If none of the retries are successful, no further attempts are made. Retries take place across a total of eighteen hours at intervals of 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 240, and 720 minutes. ou can view, and configure the webhook at any time in the [Business level administration](doc:business-level-administration) of [The Hub](https://hub.checkout.com/). As a way of ensuring at-least-once delivery, an endpoint may receive a webhook more than once if the message queuing service receives duplicate copies of a message. Although this is a rare occurrence, we recommend that endpoints process webhooks in a manner that anticipates duplicates and deals with them appropriately. To do this, save all original webhooks, and when a new webhook is received, disregard it if it already exists.

Safely detect duplicate webhooks by only accepting a single webhook with the same eventType and message.id.

Requests sent from the message queuing service to an endpoint will time out after 30 seconds. Therefore it's vital for the endpoint to return a 2xx HTTP status code before this time expires and the request fails.
