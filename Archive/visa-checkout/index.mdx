Visa Checkout is no longer available for sandbox testing. It is now only available in production.

This feature is only available to merchants already integrated with Visa Checkout.

This endpoint allows merchants integrated with **Visa Checkout **to submit a Call ID (provided by Visa) and receive a card token in response. The card token is a temporary reference of card details which is stored on our gateway and has a lifetime of 15 minutes. It can be used to create a charge using our [payment with card token endpoint](doc:authorize-a-payment).
