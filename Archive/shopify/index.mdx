Checkout.com's payment gateway is fully integrated with Shopify. Merchants already using Shopify can easily accept payments through our gateway by configuring a few simple settings. Once you receive your secret and public keys from our integration team, please follow these steps outlined below. 1. Log in to your [Shopify Admin](https://www.shopify.com/login?redirect=authorize_gateway%2F1031113). 2. After logging in, you should see the **Add payment gateway** message. Click **Add payment gateway**.
