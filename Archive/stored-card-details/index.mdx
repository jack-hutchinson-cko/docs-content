Requirements, by both Visa and Mastercard, state that merchants must provide extra information about transactions using stored card details—transactions where the merchant handles and stores card details \*\*in full\*\* on their server or uses cards tokenized at Checkout.com for future payments. 

This section outlines the new regulations introduced by Visa and Mastercard—they can sound a little heavy at first, but keep reading for more information. #### For Visa and Mastercard \* While initiating a payment, the merchant must indicate if they are using \*\*previously stored card details\*\*. \* For recurring payments, the initial cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) should not be marked as recurring, however, all subsequent payments in the subscription plan should be. #### For Visa \* In recurring and \[unscheduled merchant-initiated transactions\](doc:stored-card-details#section-unscheduled-merchant-initiated-transaction), the merchant must reference either \[the originating payment or the previous payment\](doc:stored-card-details#section-recurring-payments-fa-cc-visa-). ## Satisfying these requirements To satisfy these requirements, we've introduced the following attributes to our endpoints. \* \`cardOnFile\` Set to \`true\` if you're making a payment with our \[full card API\](doc:payment-with-full-card-details-pci-warning) using card details previously stored on \*\*your\*\* server. \* \`transactionIndicator\` Set this to \`2\` to indicate that the authorization or payment is part of a recurring plan. \* \`previousChargeId\` Used to reference either the previous transaction or the opening transaction of the payment plan. The \`previousChargeId\` is the \`chargeId\` issued after the authorization of the relevant payment. Learn more about the \[previous charge ID\](doc:stored-card-details#section-previous-charge-id-explained) Check which attributes apply to you, by reading the applicable business models below. # Cardholder-initiated transactions In a cardholder-initiated transaction, the cardholder is actively involved in initiating the payment and authorizes the use of their stored card details. For example, a cardholder ordering takeaway food and using a card previously stored with the merchant. ## Required attributes for CITs #### Visa required attributes for CITs

\### Previous charge ID explained Use the attribute \`previousChargeId\` to reference either the previous transaction or the opening transaction of the payment series. The \`previousChargeId\` is the \`chargeId\` issued after the authorization of the relevant payment. Your previous charge ID will contain the prefix \`charge\_\`, for example, \`charge\_B41BEAAC175U76BD3EE1\`. #### Example: Using the previous charge ID Recurring payments and unscheduled MITs can begin in two ways: a zero dollar authorization or a payment transaction. In the example below, a user could reference their \`previousChargeId\` as either row one or row four.
