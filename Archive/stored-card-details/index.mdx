Requirements, by both Visa and Mastercard, state that merchants must provide extra information about transactions using stored card details—transactions where the merchant handles and stores card details **in full** on their server or uses cards tokenized at Checkout.com for future payments.

This section outlines the new regulations introduced by Visa and Mastercard—they can sound a little heavy at first, but keep reading for more information. #### For Visa and Mastercard _ While initiating a payment, the merchant must indicate if they are using **previously stored card details**. _ For recurring payments, the initial cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) should not be marked as recurring, however, all subsequent payments in the subscription plan should be. #### For Visa _ In recurring and [unscheduled merchant-initiated transactions](doc:stored-card-details#section-unscheduled-merchant-initiated-transaction), the merchant must reference either [the originating payment or the previous payment](doc:stored-card-details#section-recurring-payments-fa-cc-visa-). ## Satisfying these requirements To satisfy these requirements, we've introduced the following attributes to our endpoints. _ `cardOnFile` Set to `true` if you're making a payment with our [full card API](doc:payment-with-full-card-details-pci-warning) using card details previously stored on **your** server. _ `transactionIndicator` Set this to `2` to indicate that the authorization or payment is part of a recurring plan. _ `previousChargeId` Used to reference either the previous transaction or the opening transaction of the payment plan. The `previousChargeId` is the `chargeId` issued after the authorization of the relevant payment. Learn more about the [previous charge ID](doc:stored-card-details#section-previous-charge-id-explained) Check which attributes apply to you, by reading the applicable business models below. # Cardholder-initiated transactions In a cardholder-initiated transaction, the cardholder is actively involved in initiating the payment and authorizes the use of their stored card details. For example, a cardholder ordering takeaway food and using a card previously stored with the merchant. ## Required attributes for CITs #### Visa required attributes for CITs

### Previous charge ID explained Use the attribute `previousChargeId` to reference either the previous transaction or the opening transaction of the payment series. The `previousChargeId` is the `chargeId` issued after the authorization of the relevant payment. Your previous charge ID will contain the prefix `charge\_`, for example, `charge_B41BEAAC175U76BD3EE1`. #### Example: Using the previous charge ID Recurring payments and unscheduled MITs can begin in two ways: a zero dollar authorization or a payment transaction. In the example below, a user could reference their `previousChargeId` as either row one or row four.
