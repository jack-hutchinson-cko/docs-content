We take the utmost care in ensuring that changes to our APIs do not break your integrations. We consider the following changes to be backward-compatible: - Adding new API resources/endpoints. - Adding new, optional request fields/parameters to existing APIs. - Adding new fields to existing API responses. - Adding new, optional HTTP request headers. - Adding new HTTP response headers. - Increasing the length of existing string field values. - Changing the format of identifiers including changing or removing prefixes. - Adding new webhook event types (you will need to explicitly opt into these). Note that the above also applies to changes in our webhook event schemas. In the event that a breaking change is completely unavoidable e.g. for compliance reasons, we will contact you in advance to ensure that you have sufficient time to update your integration. Full details of API changes can be found below in our API changelog.

\## August 14, 2018 We’ve updated the \[Broadcast events API\](doc:broadcast-events-api) so you can search using \`chargeId\` and \`trackId\`. This will allow you to easily find events related to a particular payment. See more information \[here\](doc:broadcast-events-api#section-api-get-events-ordered-descending). ## June 26, 2018 \`previousChargeId\` now supports Visa’s scheme transaction ID. See more information \[here\](doc:stored-card-details). ## April 2, 2018 To support the new requirements from Visa and Mastercard for payments using stored card details, a new \`cardOnFile\` and a new \`previousChargeId\` field must be included in charge requests where applicable. See more information \[here\](doc:stored-card-details). ## March 21, 2018 Financial institutions now need to provide the \`recipientDetails\` in their charge requests when processing any domestic UK transactions. See more information \[here\](doc:requirements-for-financial-institutions). ## February 2, 2018 We have introduced new chargeback and retrieval webhooks to help keep you up to date on your payments. You can subscribe to them by updating your configuration through our \[Broadcast API\](doc:broadcast-webhook-management) or via \[The Hub\](doc:broadcast-webhooks-the-hub).
